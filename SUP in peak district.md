## Cromford Canal

![People with their dogs near cromford canal](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2978/5848/files/cromford-canal.jpg?v=1642591137)

Cromford Canal lies in the Derwent Valley Mills and was originally built in 1794 as a waterway to carry coal and limestone to and from the area’s iron industry. 

The canal stretches over 14.5 miles, with the Southern end being a local nature reserve that is a refuge for threatened and declining species, like grass snakes and water vole. 

Cromford Canal is a popular British canoeing destination, but due to the nature reserve, limited permits are available, and the number of canoes, kayaks, and [paddle boards](https://uk.gilisports.com/collections/inflatable-paddle-boards "Inflatable paddle boards") are strictly controlled. 

Numerous car parks can be found along the canal and once you’ve finished your paddle for the day, the picturesque scenery makes an incredible leisurely stroll and picnic stop. 

Dragonflies, canal-side cottages, bridges, and tunnels can be found and seen along the canal, so you truly can unwind and take in the beautiful British countryside, all from the comfort of your SUP. 

## River Derwent

The River Derwent is the largest river in the Peak District and flows for over 50 miles throughout the county of Derbyshire before joining the River Trent just south of Derby. 

The Derwent flows into three large reservoirs that were built in the early 20th century to aid in the demand for water for the cities of Nottingham, Sheffield, Leicester, and Derby. The Howden and Derwent Reservoirs were built before 1916 and later were joined by the largest of the three, LadyBower Reservoir in 1935. 

As the river flows, the landscape drastically changes and you can expect to paddle through waters surrounded by limestone, wooded areas, and high cliffs. Bridges, mills, and an abundance of wildlife can also be found along the river, providing you with the perfect paddling scenery. 

The river supplies different levels of water conditions and you can expect to find water grades suited to everyone. The seven-mile stretch from Bamford to Calver provides calm waters with a slight difficulty increase towards the end of the run. 

Darley Dale to Matlock Stretch and the Slalom Course is suitable for white water paddlers who want to [practice their paddling skills](https://uk.gilisports.com/blogs/sup-expert-advice/how-to-improve-your-paddle-board-technique "Improve your paddle board technique") on slightly more intense rapids. The final sections of the river occasionally see some rapids but are mainly calm and slow-flowing.

Visitor centers, car parks, cafes, and toilets can be found along the River Derwent and its country parks. 

## Carsington Water

Carsington Water is a fantastic UK destination for a large selection of outdoor activities. 

Cycling, walking, fishing, watersports, and horse riding are regularly enjoyed at the waters between Wirksworth and Kniveton, with plenty of toilets, shops, and outdoor areas surrounding the reservoir. 

The Carsington Water reservoir was built in 1980 and is the ninth-largest reservoir in the UK as it is able to hold up to 7,800 million gallons of water. 

Water sports companies around the reservoir offer kayaking, canoeing, and paddle boarding classes, all of which come with an instructor and equipment rental. If you prefer to use your own gear, you can pay a small launch fee and set off next to the visitors' center. 

## Tittesworth Reservoir

Tittesworth Reservoir in Staffordshire is on the edge of the Peak District National Park and is another fantastic place to take your SUP and enjoy everything that the English countryside has to offer. 

The reservoir was constructed in 1858 and pumps 28 million liters of water a day to homes and businesses in the area while also acting as a storage tank for the water of winter floods. 

Bird watching is extremely popular around Tittesworth and privately owned water sports companies provide sailing, kayaking, raft building, and of course, paddle boarding lessons. 

If you want to take your own [SUP](https://uk.gilisports.com/collections/all-around-paddle-boards/products/meno-inflatable-stand-up-paddle-board "Meno inflatable paddle boards for river"), a small launching fee is required at Tittesworth, with parking locations dotted around the area. 

## Peak Forest Canal

The Peak Forest Canal has 15 miles of scenic calm waters that are a haven for the paddling community because of its four launch points and car parks located along the water’s edge. 

The canal was originally built as a transport system for lime and gritstone in 1800 and can now, with the use of a paddling license, be paddled down for hours, **starting from Lockside, Marple** all the way to the canal basin. 

Two low bridges, and swing bridges, can be found along the canal, as well as a large variety of flower species.
