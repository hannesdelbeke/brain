 [google docs](https://docs.google.com/) & google sheets now supports [google keep](https://www.google.com/keep/)
 this lets you take private notes in a document. it stores a link to the doc in the note, and when viewing notes in keep from the document, it shows related notes at the top, in a related category.

 Disadvantage: 
 - data lives in the cloud, only an issue when Google goes offline.
 - You need an additional sync process to get your data offline / in Obsidian. This can be quite technical. There's a Python [sync script](https://github.com/djsudduth/keep-it-markdown) on GitHub.
   The sync script only syncs notes too Obsidian, not back to Keep. So keep notes will become outdated when updated in Obsidian.

a [repo](https://github.com/djsudduth/keep-it-markdown) to sync Google Keep to markdown, for use with [[Obsidian]]
