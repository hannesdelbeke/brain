notes in obsidian rely on [[linking]] between notes.
When you talk about something external, e.g. a github repo, you can't link to it.

So to create connections between notes, you make a note that duplicates the github repo, and just paste the URL in there. Maybe a screenshot and small description.

But it often feels just being able to link to the readme directly would be nicer. it already has an img and description.
