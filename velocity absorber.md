velocity absorber work by turning the movement energy of a sound into heat.
it let's the sound through, but scatters it.

The reason you don’t just put a wall in the way is because the sound will just bounce right back. Frictional absorbers are made up of millions of tiny fibers with space between them. They allow just enough air to pass through that it slows down and doesn’t bounce.

## cons
- needs to be very thick to totally absorb very low frequencies
