# Amazon WorkMail
Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendar service with support for existing
desktop and mobile email client applications. Amazon WorkMail gives users the ability to seamlessly
access their email, contacts, and calendars using the client application of their choice, including Microsoft
Outlook, native iOS and Android email applications, any client application supporting the IMAP protocol,
or directly through a web browser. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate
directory, use email journaling to meet compliance requirements, and control both the keys that
encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored. You can also set up interoperability
with Microsoft Exchange Server, and programmatically manage users, groups, and resources using the
Amazon WorkMail SDK.
