⚠️ kinda duplicate of [[tool distribution]]

in a project, we distribute tons of tools.
lots of 3rd-party tools and tools for devs. not relevant

as a TA i prefer a clean setup.

allows me to install only relevant tools.
no more issues with 200 tools installed cluttering the project, or preventing it from launching when the code breaks.

[[package management]]
[[plugget]]
