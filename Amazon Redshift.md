# Amazon Redshift
Amazon Redshift is the most widely used cloud data warehouse. It makes it fast, simple and costeffective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools.


It allows you to run complex analytic queries against terabytes to petabytes of structured and semistructured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance storage,
and massively parallel query execution. Most results come back in seconds. You can start small for just
$0.25 per hour with no commitments and scale out to petabytes of data for $1,000 per terabyte per
year, less than a tenth the cost of traditional on-premises solutions.
