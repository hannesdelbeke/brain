great app for drawing vector art.

there's a [[Obsidian plugin]]

### Add to library
I use this for UX design of my tools:

Add some presets to your Excalidraw library in Obsidian.
1. click on library on right side
2. click browse
3. search for `universal ui kit` and download it
4. go back to library, and import it
