## optimize plugins
I increased startup from 2.2 sec to 0.3 sec by disabling and delaying plugins
- in community plugins, enable debug startup time to see startup time
- disable unused plugins
- use [[Obsidian plugin - Plugin Groups]]
## other
No noticeable impact. [[always set process priority to high]]

[[Obsidian]]
