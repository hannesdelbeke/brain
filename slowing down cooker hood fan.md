slow down a [[fan]] in a [[cooker hood]] to reduce noise. 

an [[induction motor]] speed can only be changed by altering the frequency.
- higher powered AC machines need a 'proper' speed controller to vary the frequency, else they could be overloaded
- domestic fans (often the shaded-pole type of induction motor) have such a high resistance winding that their stalled current is little different from their normal FLC. 
  Therefore, the speed control for such a fixed load as a fan impeller is easily achieved by limiting the supply voltage without fiddling around with the frequency.

- Cheap _fan_ controllers, like light dimmers, can cause buzzing from the _fan_
- Some dimmer switches may cause the fan to get on fire
