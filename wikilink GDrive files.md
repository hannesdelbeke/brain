I want to [[use more links in life]]
I already can link to [[Google Drive]] files, but these links don't show in [[Obsidian auto complete]].

examples
- in a daily dev note I can link the script I worked on that day
- in a tax return note, I can link the related sheets and csvs and pdfs stored on drive
- in a daily personal note i can link a picture form [[Google Photos]]
