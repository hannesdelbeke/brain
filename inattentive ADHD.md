Inattentive ADHD (often called ADD), a type of ADHD, primarily involves difficulties with focus, organization, and attention. 
- difficulty paying attention to details, 
- trouble staying focused on tasks, distractibility
- A tendency to be easily distracted or forgetful.

Unlike the hyperactive-impulsive type, individuals with inattentive ADHD may not exhibit hyperactivity or impulsivity to the same extent. 

It can be mistaken for anxiety or a [[mood disorder]] in adults.
