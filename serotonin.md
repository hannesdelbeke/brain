Serotonin helps your body to:

- balance your mood and experience pleasure
- heal wounds
- clot blood
- control movement

More specifically, serotonin intervenes in these functions:

- **Bowel movements:** [About 90%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8198651/) of the serotonin in your body is produced in your intestines. It helps control bowel movements and function.
- **Mood:** Serotonin in the brain is believed to regulate feelings, including happiness and [[anxiety]]. 
  [Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris) are thought to help treat mood disorders like [[depression]] by increasing serotonin activity in your brain.
- **Nausea:** Serotonin in your stomach and intestines helps your body feel [nausea](https://www.healthline.com/health/nausea) and start vomiting in response to [[illness]], foods, or other conditions.
- **Sleep and waking:** Neurotransmitters, including serotonin, regulate your ability to stay awake. While you sleep, serotonin is involved in switching between [REM and non-REM sleep](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/stages-of-sleep).
- **Blood clotting:** Platelets in your blood store serotonin. When your body needs to repair damage, platelets release serotonin to help stop bleeding and heal wounds.
- **Sex drive:** Serotonin is involved in controlling the body’s sexual functions. This may be why medications that affect serotonin levels are associated with [sexual side effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/antidepressant-sexual-side-effects).
