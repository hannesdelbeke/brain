Facebook Messenger doesn't support silencing it's notifications on Android.

You can disable notifications, but then you won't get any.

Or you can do a work around.
1. download an empty mp3 file here ([source](https://github.com/anars/blank-audio/blob/master/1-second-of-silence.mp3))
2. use a file manager to move it to `internal storage/notifications` folder
3. Change the notification sound to `1 second of silence`

Vibrate is still enabled, but no more sound
