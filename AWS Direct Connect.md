# AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises
to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your
data center, office, or co-location environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs,
increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based
connections.
AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and
one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1Q virtual LANS (VLANs), this
dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same
connection to access public resources, such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space,
and private resources such as EC2 instances running within a VPC using private IP address space, while
maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be
reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.
