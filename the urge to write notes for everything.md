Today I wrote a lot of notes. But I expect I wont read most of them again unlike my usual productivity notes, e.g. on `programming`.
Today I am quite tired because of a hang over, and I've noticed that being tired often leads to fake productivity. Being busy but not getting much done

I think [[perfection|perfectionism]], the same reason discussed in  [[not finishing books]], is why I want to write down all my thoughts and discoveries. And why I struggle to stop writing a half written note, and just drop it.

This is not an effective use of my time, but it's fun. 
- I write because I want to write.
- It gives a sense of achievement 
- I feel a sense of contribution, imagining that people are positively influenced after reading my notes. It's Interesting that I feel this even if nobody would ever read my notes. 
	- e.g. They read something that emotionally resonates with them. 
	- Or learn something from reading my notes.
	- I think that maybe someone will one day read these notes.

Fake productivity. I'm busy creating things, even if those things don't matter.
e.g. [[writing notes about notes]]

It does however improve my writing skills, so it's not a complete waste of time.

I likely won't even reread this note myself, so why am I writing it? It is more like [[journaling]], like therapy, than note taking. But maybe it will remind myself or someone else to stick to [[minimal notetaking]], or maybe I just needed the journaling today. And this wasn't a waste of time.
