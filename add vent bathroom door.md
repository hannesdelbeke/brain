New build UK [[house|houses]] should have a gap of 10mm between the door and floor. (My bathroom has this.) That's a surface of 8 cm², which should be (just) enough for the fan.

There's no need for an extra vent, unless the fan struggles.
You can do toilet paper test in front of fan to test if the fan struggles
- does it stick to fan
- does it barely move
- does it fall off the fan

A more practical test is, 30-60mins after a shower:
- Is the bathroom air still humid?
- Is the [[mirror]] still fogged up?
- Are the walls still damp?
