Your brain can only hold so much info at a time, so it uses tricks to do more.

- [[chunking]]: Abstracting multiple concepts into 1 concept, allows your brain to understand the whole picture without taking up as much brainpower.
	e.g. chess players recognize moves based on the whole board
- [[habit|habits]] let you do tasks with a reduced [[cognitive load]].
- [[cache]] - recent events are more likely to predict the near future than past events. Recent memories are more relevant than old ones. That's why we forget, the brain is efficient, [[optimization|optimizing]] itself. - [[Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve]]

- **Schemas**: Mental frameworks that help you quickly interpret new information based on past experiences.
- Example: You instantly know how to behave in a restaurant because you've internalized the "restaurant schema."

- **Automation through repetition**: Beyond habits, repeated exposure builds automaticity — like typing without thinking about key placement.
- **Selective attention**: Your brain filters out irrelevant stimuli to focus on what matters.

- Example: You tune out background noise while reading, even though your ears still register it.

- **Pattern recognition**: You spot familiar structures or sequences, which speeds up decision-making.

- Example: Recognizing a face or predicting the next note in a melody.

- **Mental shortcuts (heuristics)**: Fast, rule-of-thumb strategies for decision-making.

- Example: “Availability heuristic” — judging something as more likely if it comes to mind easily.

- **Working memory compression**: You temporarily group data into meaningful units to hold more at once.

- Example: Remembering a phone number as “+44 791” instead of seven separate digits.

- **Default mode network**: When your brain is at rest, it still processes and organizes information — often leading to insights or creative breakthroughs.
- **Cognitive offloading**: Using external tools (notes, apps, reminders) to reduce mental strain.

- Example: Offloading birthdays to your calendar so your brain doesn’t have to store them.
