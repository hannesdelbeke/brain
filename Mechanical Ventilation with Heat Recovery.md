A MVHR ventilates a house while reducing heat-loss, using [[countercurrent heat exchange]].
It's a [[centralized]] unit that ventilates the whole house using [[ducting]].
(For decentralized units see [[Decentralised Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|dMVHR]]) 
For energy (air humidity ) recovering, see [[ERV]], ERVs are better.

It's recommend for buildings with good air tightness levels, e.g. air permeability of the thermal envelope at or below` 3 m3.hr/m2Â @50Pa`.

- Vent axia typical extract fans are good but their MVHR units aren't, 
- Nuaire also not great
- good: s&p energisave 250 (envirovent)

> [!TIP] Tip
> calculate the m/3 size of your accommodation and ask the supplier what m/3 size accommodation that model is designed for. You want to oversize your mvhr unit so you can have the fans running on a low setting this not only reduces the noise of the fans but also prolongs the life of the moving parts inside so less maintenance costs. Eg, for a 150 m/3 property u would specify a unit that can provide ventilation for a property at 180m/3 minimum.

Improves [[air quality]], the ventilation reduces humidity, and the intake filter reduces pollen & dust.
