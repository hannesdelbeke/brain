A MVHR ventilates a house while reducing heat-loss, using [[countercurrent heat exchange]].
It's a centralized unit that ventilates the whole house. (For decentralized units see [[Decentralised Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|dMVHR]]) using [[ducting]]

It's recommend for buildings with good air tightness levels, e.g. air permeability of the thermal envelope at or below` 3 m3.hr/m2Â @50Pa`.
