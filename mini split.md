A mini-split is a single-zone [[ductless]] [[heat pump]] system that consists of 1 indoor unit and 1 outdoor unit. 
Either unit can act as a _condenser_ or _evaporator_ to draw heat energy from ambient air.

- [[decentralized]] air conditioner, sometimes can also heat.
- decentralized [[heat pump]]. can control each room (zone control)

Economic to handle 1 room, if 2 rooms need [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|HVAC]] a [[multi split]] is better.

this [article](https://kaspars.net/blog/mini-split-space-hot-water-heating) talks about using minisplits in a [[passive house]] for heating.

## how it works
It works by moving heat from one place to another. By transporting only that thermal energy, and not air, it provides heating and cooling throughout the house without ductwork. The refrigerant travels through the system via narrow piping to transport the heat.
