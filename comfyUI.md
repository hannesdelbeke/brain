 [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/tree/master).
 This editor is the only comfortable way to keep up to date with all the recent updates. Previous UIs just can't keep up with this and look scary.  
The tool offers cool advantages:  

1. Any workflow you assemble is sharable and you can save it as a template ~~visible to everyone~~ visible just for you (unfortunately).
2. Any workflow you assemble with nodes can be automatically **converted into** **~~deployable~~** **python code**.
3. There are plenty of nodes and possibility to use custom nodes for every latest thing in SD space.
4. You can switch main SD models now, controlNets, LoRas -- much more control over your creations.
5. It is faster.

### templates
Templates are saved in your cookies in the browser and they are not visible to everyone..
Workflow templates can easily be found by right click and select `Node Templates`

- You can just drag images saved from this tool into web editor and the workflow will automatically load from those images (using metadata saved into those png files). 
	- (slack removes metadata from images)
- The main button to press called `Queue Prompt` just in case!
