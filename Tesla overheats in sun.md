My [[Tesla model 3]]  gets hot in summer on the drive in the sun.
The app has a vent feature under controls that opens the [[window|windows]] 10 cm.

It would be ideal if I could program it.
- open windows if temp is high (car already has temp sensor)
- don't do if it rains (already has rain sensor)
