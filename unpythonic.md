Something unpythonic, is something that goes against the standards used by [[Python]] devs. It's the opposite of something [[pythonic]]

e.g. The standard name for the first arg of a method is `self`
not doing so would be unpythonic, but it would work.
```python
class MyClass():
	def method1(self):
		pass
	def method2(my_class_instance):
		pass
	
```
