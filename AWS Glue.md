# AWS Glue
AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers
to prepare and load their data for analytics. You can create and run an ETL job with a few clicks in the
AWS Management Console. You simply point AWS Glue to your data stored on AWS, and AWS Glue
discovers your data and stores the associated [[metadata]] (e.g. table definition and schema) in the AWS
Glue Data Catalog. Once cataloged, your data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available for
ETL.
