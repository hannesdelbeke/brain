I stumbled on a [post](https://sive.rs/nowff) (2015) that introduces now pages. 
Most are [[link rot|dead]] but [this one](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/now/) is still up, pretty cool to see it's still going strong nearly 10 years later. (2024-05-12)
[[fun discoveries]]

I haven't made one myself yet, since I don't think I'll keep it updated for now. But I wrote [[now note]] to revisit the concept. (And I did the day after!)
