I want to start using [[Obsidian]] to manage my notes, but am overwhelmed. Where do I start?

1. Install Obsidian 
2. Start writing notes in markdown files without organizing them.
   don't worry about the structure or if you do it right.
2. Learn [[wikilink]]
   Simply type `[[` and the name of a note, to link that note
   This is the key to getting good at note taking in Obsidian.
3. Use hashtags to create trends across your notes. It'll help you with noticing patterns across your notes.

That's it!

Once you get more familiar with Obsidian, install some plugins, tweak the settings, etc. I worked a long time without any plugins.

most plugins are optional, these days I use:
- [[Obsidian plugin - Git]] to [[backup]] your notes on git
- `paste URL into selection`, to select a word and paste a URL
- `paste image png to jpg`, to easy paste images from the internet in jpg
- [execute code](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code)`
