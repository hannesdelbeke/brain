- `BLENDER_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS` points to a folder of [[Blender extension]]s 
  (see [[Blender environment variables]])
- default user folder is `C:\Users\H\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.3\extensions\blender_org\jiggle_physics`
- it contains non zip files, despite docs saying extensions should be build as zip
