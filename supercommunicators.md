Supercommunicators - How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection is a [[book]] that talks about the traits of good communicators. It uses stories to show how people overcame difficult sitations with the use of great [[communication]] skills.

# Summary
3 key insights from the book
- The goal of a meaningful [[conversation]] is connection
- Most of our conversations fall into [[3 conversation categories]]
- Being a **supercommunicator** means asking more questions
## ask questions
supercommunicators are high-centrality participants
- Good communicators can steer conversations (and allegedly create [[neural entrainment]])
- they're not the loudest, but enable others to speak and feel heard. They're facilitators. Having them in groups makes the group much more effective.
- Before speaking, they ask "why am i speaking?", they speak with purpose
- ask 10-20 times more questions
## build connections
good communicators build trust in a conversation with
- [[open-ended question|open-ended questions]]
- [[active listening]] lets the other know you are listening with [[backchanneling]]
- [[mirroring]]
	- [[match energy in a conversation]] (mood & tone)
	- match emotions: reciprocate when someone shares feelings 
	- use [[body language]] and tone of voice (energy?)
- **Always** try to [[reciprocate]] when someone shares personal details and ask follow up questions.
- Share your goals, ask others about needs and feelings, and explore identities related to the conversation.
- being easy to read can make someone more trustworthy and approachable, but it also means they might be more emotionally vulnerable in conversations

**summary**
all we need to do is 
- listen to what's said and unsaid, (hearing someone out)
- ask the right questions to understand their perspective
- recognize and match the others' mood, and make our own feelings easy to perceive.

## other
- Avoid sarcasm and direct criticism, especially online
- Ask Deep Questions
- Embrace Differences: Acknowledge and appreciate diverse perspectives to build understanding and connection
