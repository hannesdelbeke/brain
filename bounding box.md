A bounding box is a rectangular box that completely encloses an object in [[2D]] or [[3D]] space. It is defined by its minimum and maximum coordinates along the X, Y, and Z axes. 

Bounding boxes are often used in computer graphics, physics simulations, and collision detection to simplify calculations and improve performance.
