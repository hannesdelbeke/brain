[[unity]] 
 [[tool launcher]]

unity menu's tend to contain a lot of files.
create a command browser that can search and run a command
plugin infrastructure

mode 1: pure commands
- recreate all default unity menu commands. e.g. open project settings
- custom commands. e.g. launch my editor tool (this can also be a menu command)

mode 2: right click commands in asset browser
right click shows a lot of commands in the project browser, to the point where it's overwhelming and fills the whole screen.
instead show an option that says "browse commands"
this opens a command browser with commands that run on that directory
