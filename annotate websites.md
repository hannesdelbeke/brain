most of these, including hypothesis, are closed source, paid products.
Some used to have a free tier which was removed.
The benefits are often the social side, replying on notes online.
And an easy to install [[Chrome]] extension 

### Free
- one of the top ones so far, no limitations on free [[Hypothesis review]] and has a basic Obsidian plugin
- https://nimbusweb.me (free unlimited tier up to 20 members) 16k ⭐ on chrome, appears to be mainly oriented around screenshots and filming
- https://memex.garden/ 90⭐ free (for now), chrome extension, [open source](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex)
	- [template](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/ohfow6/memex_export_to_obsidian_template/) to manual copy notes to [[Obsidian]] 
	- there's a [[backup]] .js tool, [repo](https://github.com/WorldBrain/local-backup-server/blob/master/HTTPKoaServer.js)
- context-note, a bad [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/context-note/enmeffcefbiehghanidhebgiccljmncl), local, export notes to json

### Premium (or limited features on free)
- https://www.diigo.com/ free (limited cloud annotations !) 2k⭐on chrome, seems good, no obsidian plug yet, see [discussion](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bookmarks-from-diigo-obsidian-vault/27047/2)
- [markup.io](https://www.markup.io/pricing/) has the same concept (50$/month) per team, 20 notes limit
- [Marker.io](https://marker.io/) (50$/month 5 users) makes it easy for your team and clients to take web page screenshots and annotate them.
- [markups.kdanmobile.com](https://markups.kdanmobile.com/) has the same concept. limitation on free. 40$/user/year
- https://www.fleetingnotes.app/  
	- ⚠️ bug on chrome, now you need to press back twice to go back, very annoying
	- [**discord**](https://discord.gg/xrj6yuGNmx)
	- https://github.com/fleetingnotes obsidian and chrome plugin
	- great backlinking support, can sync to [[Obsidian]] 
	- no sidebar, notes disappear in browser

### unknown
- https://spade.tools/ save highlights in cloud
- https://glasp.co/


### Clipper
Web annotators are similar to clippers. the difference is that clippers write to a file, but do not show the current annotations when you open the URL in your browser.
- https://github.com/jplattel/obsidian-clipper/ for Chrome & Firefox

### Ideal
The perfect plugin would have 
- option to sync files to local markdown
- not just notes, but also drawing / graph functionality. e.g. Obsidian canvas
  e.g. https://github.com/nimeshnayaju/tldrawe
- a browser plugin to see notes while browsing



#todo checkout https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#demos
this seems very powerful but complex. to get highlights in your browser
- great [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/oo96v0/trying_to_collect_my_browsing_highlights_through/) regarding memex, hypothesis, promnesia, [Readwise.io](https://readwise.io/)
