When the sun shines (UV light) through the windows, it is either reflected back, or absorbed inside and converted to heat. 

The most [[solar gain]] is on the west side of a [[house]].
The second most is on south side, but this is easier to prevent with [[external shades]] because of the high angle of the sun.

## Benefit
Solar gain is great in the winter, heating up your house for free.
## Prevention
Once the heat is in, it won't easily leave the house. So the best prevention is to stop it outside with [[external shades]]. Or with the shade of a [[tree]].
