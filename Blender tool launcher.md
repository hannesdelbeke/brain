central ways to launch multiple Blender tools
### Default ways to launch tools
Each add-on needs to add support for these methods, which isn't great for supporting consistency between third party tools. But if you only use your own tools this can be an option.
- side bar / [[Blender  N-Panel]]
- to show in the Blender menu. 
### third party addons
Create a central place to launch tools from with a third party solution.  
- [[Blender addon - quick menu|quick menu]] creates a right-click menu in the viewport.
- [[plugget]] mainly installs [[Blender addon|addons]], but can also be used to launch tools & run commands
- [[buttonizer]], a window with buttons to launch tools
- [[unimenu addon]], extend Blender's menu to launch tools 
- [ ] TODO create an [[app launcher]] for Blender
