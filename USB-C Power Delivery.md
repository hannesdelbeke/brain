USB-C PD is a new standard that can deliver up to 240 watts of power.

USB-C ports without Power Delivery are capable of delivering 5V at 3A for a total of 15 watts. This is sufficient to charge a smartphone in about 30 minutes and a tablet in 2.5 hours.

[[USB]] Power Delivery (USB-PD) refers to the protocol that allows a "power provider," a cable and a "power consumer" to agree on the current and voltage levels. Because power can flow in either direction, the role of provider and consumer can change at any time.

All [[USB-C]] Cables Support PD
