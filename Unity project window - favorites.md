Overall a quite useless feature in the [[Unity Project window]]

- only visible in 2 column layout
- can't [[favorite]] assets, only folders (drag & drop) and proj-view searches (click the star‚≠ê)
  view searches are different from [[Unity search]] searches

Unknowns
- unsure if committed to repo or local
- I read this is shared across projects?

## alternatives
[[Unity search]] supports 
- favoriting assets, but there's no way to see your favorited assets.
- favoriting (=save) searches, you are able to see your saved searches on the side

many plugins do this

favorite assets
