Imagine you can subscribe to other [[personal knowledge management|PKM]] [[wiki|wikis]] and [[digital garden|digital gardens]], add them to your [[favorite|favorites]] or resources.

- see when your friend has released a new note 😮
- some notes recommended based on your history
- manage notes online, in a browser. subscribe share ...
- [[notification]] when someone links to your page, likes your note, ...
- link requests, when someone wants to link to your note, if you accept, it shows in the backlinks section.

This reminds me of substack.com
- I can follow someone, to get updates when they post
- recommendations based on my reading history
- manage subscriptions online
The only thing missing is backlinks.
But this is more of a [[blog]] than a personal [[digital garden]]
- Data is hosted on their servers, not locally
- No backlinks
- Not designed for [[Evergreen notes]]

this person is using a blog as PKM, and what appears to be backlinks `pingback`
