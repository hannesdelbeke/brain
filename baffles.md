baffles hang from the ceiling to reduce the [[echo]] in a room.
they hang so the sound isn't transferred to the ceiling.

sometimes they look like they are attached but it's a small hook that hangs from a beam attached to the ceiling. [example](https://www.ecophon.com/uk/ecophon/free-hanging-units-and-baffles/solo/solo-baffle-wave/) the Ecophon Soloâ„¢ Baffle Wave

similar to [[acoustic ceiling panel]]

great at treating [[flutter echo]], but depending on the material it might not have absorption.
