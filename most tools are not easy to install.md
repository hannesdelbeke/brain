most tools are not easy to install because of the need to 
- install it in a certain location,
- install dependencies
- manually enable it
- sometimes restart the app

The obvious issue is not knowing how to do this, for users not familiar with the workflow.

But I find myself still with resistance on installing a tool, even if I made it. It takes effort to recall where to install it. To browse to the folders, and check them, or to come up with the command that installs the dependencies. I know how to do it, but my brain gives me resistance, because of the  [[cognitive load]].

Ideally installing tools would be like the Google Play store, you look up the tool and click install. Done!

[[plugget]] is my attempt at this, but it's still rough around the edges.
