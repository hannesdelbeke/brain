[[AMEX]] only covers if i can refuse [[insurance]].
> You have [[car hire|car rental]] insurance with the Amex Platinum card as long as you reject any extra insurance options with the rental company basically. If you do have a collision, the rental company will charge you an excess and you make a claim with Amex (thru AXA I think?) to get the excess back.

my AMEX You are covered for:
- Global Assistance Service
- Purchase Protection
- Refund Protection
- Travel Accident - public transport only
The above coverages are underwritten by [[AXA]] but your card may also include cover (eg. Car Rental Benefits) that is underwritten by a different insurance company.You should refer to your T&Cs and contact that company directly.
