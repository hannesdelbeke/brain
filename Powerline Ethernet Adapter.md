Extend your [[Ethernet]] at home through your electric wall sockets

TLDR: Usually not reliable, only use when no [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Ethernet port]] are available.
### Tips
- [[Powerline]] supports distances up to 300m.
- Try buy one with a pass-through outlet (also cuts out data noise)
- Look out for Gigabit Ethernet ports for the fastest transfers. Most quality Powerline adapters go for this standard, but entry-level 500Mbs adapters often have the slower 10/100 Ethernet ports.
- some have a [[Wi-Fi hotspot]], which is superior to [[Wi-Fi extender]]

### Pros & Cons
Cons 
- Powerline adapters need to plug directly into AC wall sockets and nothing in-between.
- Phone chargers & microwaves interfere with signals over electrical current
- unreliable speed, use [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Multimedia over Coax]] instead

Pros
- excellent option for hard-to-cable structures or too costly installations
- no need for extra cabling, take it with you when you move.

## Speed
[Outbrain](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/723387/best-powerline-adapters.html "Best Powerline Adapters")Â consumer testing reported a 200Mbps Powerline achieves speeds between 20 and 90Mbps, while 500Mbps kits reach speeds between 20 and 200Mbps. 

e.g. a Gigabit 1,300Mbps fastest real-world speed was 115Mbps
- TP-Link AV1300 top speed was 410Mbps (same wall)
- few walls away
	- TP-Link AV1300 (100Mbps)
	- Solwise SmartLink 1200AV2: (107Mbps) 
	-  Devolo 1200 (104Mbps).
	- TP-Link 300Mbps AV500 (68Mbps average, up to 92)
