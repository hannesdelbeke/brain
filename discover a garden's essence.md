## Problem
You walk around in a maze in a [[digital garden]]. Behind every corner you take you find a note, but none of them resonate. The author crafted a garden so big, you don't know where to start. Leaving you lost.

Digital gardens often are a collection of random notes. It's great if you know what subject you are looking for, but what if you just discover a garden that looks interesting, but you don't know where to find content you want?

## Solutions
The [[now note]] is a good concept to tackle this, showing the most active interests of the author.

A visual graph also solves this, letting you see the biggest most connected nodes.

I also like the `popular` pages, that show the most read / visited pages. 
## example
I discovered this nice PKM, but I don't know where to find the authors core interests. Eventually I discovered one of their [projects](https://anthonyamar.fr/Projects/Books+and+Binders), which is clearly something they put a lot of time in. 
*The author has a [changelog](https://anthonyamar.fr/%CE%A9+Changelog/~+Changelog), which wasn't easy to find. But it's manually updated, and therefor outdated.*

Example done well: A blog with both a [popular](https://nesslabs.com/popular), [best articles](https://nesslabs.com/best), and [latest](https://nesslabs.com/articles) page 
see [[most popular]]

PS: this is less about note taking and more about publishing said notes.
