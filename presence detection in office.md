I was thinking of getting a [[PIR sensor]] in my office
- Instead of detecting motion with a PIR sensor, I can just measure computer activity.
- To measure light level, instead of a lux sensor, I can get sun times and calculate the light level. This won't help with cloudiness, but it's mostly at night I need it.
