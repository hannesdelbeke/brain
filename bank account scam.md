The scammer phones you up and says "I'm sorry, I accidentally sent you £2000, please could you send it back to me? I can't pay rent otherwise!" or some other sob story and give you a sort code and account number to send it to.

You send the money, that money is now theirs and clean, you sent it deliberately, it's an authorised transaction.

In the meantime the owner of account X reports the fraud, the bank reverses the transaction, taking the initial money back out of your account. You're now £2000 down, the scammer has got £2000 "clean" money and you're on the hook as you authorised the transfer so the bank can say "sorry, not our problem, be more aware of scams"
