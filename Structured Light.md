Most low-budget depth sensors on the market use Structured Light technology which is what Kinect for Xbox 360 was known for. If you remember that very noisy depth images with big flickering parts on the edges - it’s that. This list includes:

- [[Kinect]] for Xbox 360
- Realsense F200, R200, SR300
- Orbbec Astra
- Project Tango (it’s modular, there are many options there)
- Structure sensor
- Asus Xtion

Kinect V2 uses Time-Of-Flight technology which was used in very expensive depth cameras. It has enhanced resolution, image quality, noise reduction etc. comparing to previous version. In terms of raw data processing it’s really great. The only downside (for me) is usb 3.0 (realsense has it too) that is hard to extend and its bigger size.
