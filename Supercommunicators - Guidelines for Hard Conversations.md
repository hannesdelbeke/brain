This [review](https://nutreats.co.za/supercommunicators-book-review/) of [[Supercommunicators - How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection]] seems to handle very different topics than what i remember from the book. Perhaps it's hallucinated [[AI slop]]?

- start with establishing the boundaries of the conversation
- Acknowledge discomfort
- We will make mistakes. Use the intent of curiosity and understanding, not perfection
- The goal is to share your experiences and perspectives. Don’t go in with the expectation of changing someone’s mind.
- No blaming, shaming or attacks
- Speak about your own views and experiences. Don’t generalize or describe what other people think.
- Confidentiality is important. People need to feel safe knowing that what they say won’t be repeated
- Respect is essential. Respect each other’s right to be heard even when you disagree.
- Sometimes we need to pause. If a conversation is traumatizing or painful it is a signal to stop. Encourage people to go slow, pause or step away.
