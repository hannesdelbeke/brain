Write notes, to create a [[link]] between 2 Unity assets. 
To enable very quick [[navigation]] between assets. 
This is now possible with [[Unity note editor]]

example:
1. attach this note to a prefab
   > `this prefab is used in the following scene: [[Scene1.unity]]`
2. Clicking the scene selects the scene.

## Dev
 - [x] unity notes, that link to other Unity assets. https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unity-note-editor
- [x] GUID links to other assets
- [x] some kind of note parser, with plugin support, to convert these links to clickable links in rich text.
- [ ] it'd be great to support right-click on an asset to generate & copy the link. [[Unity extend right click context menu]]
- [x] a lot of the power of these notes will come from private comments, that you don't want to commit. So figure out a local solution. [[Unity local]]
