[[Obsidian plugin]] to add [[Github Copilot]] support

1. get nodejs
```
winget install nodejs
```
2. in settings, test the nodejs path
3. wait for the "sign in to github copilot" popup in Obsidian. (I restarted Obsidian)

so far
- great when it works
- But sometimes autocomplete doesn't work and nothing shows
- it sometimes takes some time to load on startup, half a minute
