An [[Obsidian plugin]] that adds [[Github Copilot]] support

1. get [[node.js]]
2. in settings, test the nodejs path
> [!warning]
> i had issues with node not being detected anymore. path was split at space in `program files`. Changed to `C:\Progra~1\nodejs\node.exe` and it worked.
3. wait for the "sign in to github copilot" popup in Obsidian. (I restarted Obsidian)

so far
- great when it works
- But sometimes autocomplete doesn't work and nothing shows
- it sometimes takes some time to load on startup, half a minute
