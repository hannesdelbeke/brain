**Examples**
- instead of finding a solution for Google sheets, which live on Google Drive. Try to find a solution for all files on GDrive.
- in [[datafix]], i originally had multiple classes:collector, validator, ... and handled each individually. But now they inherit from a Node class, and I process them all as Nodes. A more generic solution. It's simpler, so easier to maintain and develop.
