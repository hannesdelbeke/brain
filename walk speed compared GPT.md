Walking at a slow pace (3 km/h) is less intense than walking at a brisk pace (approximately 6.4 km/h or 4 mph). To determine how much more time you would need to achieve equivalent health benefits at a slower pace, we can use the concept of [[metabolic equivalent of task]] (METs), which measures the energy cost of physical activities.
### MET Values
- **Brisk Walking (approximately 6.4 km/h)**: About 4.3 METs.
- **Slow Walking (approximately 3 km/h)**: About 2.0 METs.
### Calculating Equivalent Exercise Time
The recommended amount of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is 150 minutes per week. If brisk walking at 4.3 METs meets this recommendation, we can calculate the equivalent time needed for slow walking at 2.0 METs to achieve the same energy expenditure.
#### Formula
The equivalent time required can be calculated using the ratio of the MET values:
$$
Equivalent Time = \left( \frac{\text{Moderate MET}}{\text{Slow MET}} \right) \times \text{Recommended Time}
$$
$$
Equivalent Time = \left( \frac{\text{Slow MET}}{\text{Moderate MET}} \right) \times \text{Recommended Time}
$$
### Calculation
$$
Equivalent Time = \left( \frac{4.3}{2.0} \right) \times 150 \text{ minutes}
$$
$$
Equivalent Time=2.15 × 150 
$$
$$
Equivalent Time=322.5 
$$
### Conclusion
To achieve the same energy used as 150 minutes of brisk walking per week, you would need to walk at a slow pace (3 km/h) for approximately 322.5 minutes or  5.5 hours per week. compared to 2.5 hours of brisk walking.

## follow up
Note that you wont get the same health benefits. Since the sitting still equivalent is 10 hours and 45 minutes.

The benefits of exercise extend beyond mere energy expenditure. The intensity of the activity impacts cardiovascular health, muscle strength, metabolic function, and overall fitness levels. Here are some factors that differentiate the health benefits of slow walking compared to brisk walking:

### Cardiovascular Benefits
- **Brisk Walking**: Increases heart rate more significantly, which strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and enhances cardiovascular fitness.
- **Slow Walking**: Provides cardiovascular benefits but at a lower intensity, leading to less significant improvements in heart and lung efficiency.
### Muscle and Bone Health
- **Brisk Walking**: Engages muscles more intensely, which can lead to better muscle tone and strength. The increased impact can also improve bone density.
- **Slow Walking**: Engages muscles less intensively and provides lower impact, which might be less effective for muscle and bone health.
### Metabolic Benefits
- **Brisk Walking**: Can improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic rate more effectively, contributing to better weight management and reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.
- **Slow Walking**: Still beneficial but to a lesser extent compared to more vigorous activities.
### Mental Health and Cognitive Function
- **Brisk Walking**: Can lead to greater releases of endorphins and other mood-enhancing chemicals, contributing to better mental health.
- **Slow Walking**: Beneficial for mental health but may not have as strong an impact on mood enhancement.
### Overall Fitness
- **Brisk Walking**: Improves aerobic capacity, stamina, and overall physical fitness more effectively due to higher intensity.
- **Slow Walking**: Still beneficial for maintaining general health but less effective for significant fitness improvements.
