Concentrations of methionine, tryptophan and [[tyrosine]] were highest in fish-eaters and vegetarians, followed by meat-eaters, and lowest in vegans.
A broadly similar pattern was seen for [[lysine]], 

whereas [[alanine]] concentration was highest in fish-eaters and lowest in meat-eaters. 

For [[glycine]], vegans had the highest concentration and meat-eaters the lowest. Intakes of all 18 dietary amino acids differed by diet group; for the majority of these, intake was highest in meat-eaters followed by fish-eaters, then vegetarians and lowest in vegans (up to 47% lower than in meat-eaters).
