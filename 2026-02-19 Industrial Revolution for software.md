I love this post from [cannoneyed.com/essays/software-industrial-revolution](https://cannoneyed.com/essays/software-industrial-revolution)

Before the Industrial Revolution, the average person only owned a few pairs of [[clothes]], usually made by hand. Now, there are very few people who make clothes, but there are thousands of apparel companies for every type of activity. The Software Industrial Revolution will lead to an explosion of bespoke [[software]] across every industry and niche. The fact that we'll no longer build software by hand means that we will build and use much more of it. Everything in the economy that touches software is about to fundamentally and radically change.
