Before the Industrial Revolution, the average person only owned a few pairs of [[clothes]], usually made by hand. Now, there are very few people who make clothes, but there are thousands of apparel companies for every type of activity. The Software Industrial Revolution will lead to an explosion of bespoke [[software]] across every industry and niche. The fact that we'll no longer build software by hand means that we will build and use much more of it. Everything in the economy that touches software is about to fundamentally and radically change.

[[AI article]] below:

The transition from "hand-crafted" to "AI-industrialized" software will likely mirror the shift from artisanal tailoring to mass-market textiles, with several key impacts on the displaced technical class:

### 1. Migration to "Hard" Engineering and Physical Sciences
The "uniquely talented" minds currently optimized for logic, systems architecture, and abstraction may shift back to physical-world problems that AI cannot yet solve autonomously (e.g., fusion energy, material science, bio-engineering). This could lead to a renaissance in physical innovation as the intellectual surplus exits the digital-only realm.

### 2. Evolution from "Builders" to "Architects of Intent"
The role of the developer may shift from writing syntax (the "sewing") to defining system requirements and ethics (the "fashion design"). Those who adapt will become high-level orchestrators. Those who cannot adapt may face significant wage depression as the barrier to entry for "creating software" drops to near zero, commoditizing the skill of implementation.

### 3. Economic De-leveraging of the Technical Elite
For decades, developers have enjoyed extreme market leverage due to the scarcity of their specific cognitive profile. AI removes this scarcity. This could lead to a "hollowing out" of the technical middle class, where only the top 1% of researchers (who build the AI) and the "creative visionaries" (who direct it) remain high earners, while standard engineering labor is automated.

### 4. Intellectual Surplus and Social Friction
A large population of highly intelligent, system-oriented people finding themselves redundant can create social volatility. Historically, when a specialized intellectual class is displaced, they often move into political, regulatory, or philosophical roles, potentially leading to more rigorous (or restrictive) governance of the technologies that replaced them.

### 5. The "Artisanal" Software Market
Just as hand-made suits remain a luxury status symbol, "human-written" or "verified" code may become a premium niche for high-security or high-status applications, though this will likely only support a fraction of the current developer population.
