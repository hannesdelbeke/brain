### Why do I want to link to contacts?
I almost only use [[Google contacts]] to look up
- address
- phone number
- (rarely email, since auto complete in [[Gmail]] does that)
So it seems the impact of linking to contacts will be small


See the nice link flow example in [[TODO link contacts to photos and memories]]
