The text on the [[Windows]] lock screen often contains news, facts & ads.
But most of all, it's distracting,
increasing [[cognitive load]] every time you log in.

to remove it:
- Settings > Personalization > Lock screen 
- change the background from `windows spotlight` to "Picture" or "Slideshow" 
- toggle off "Get fun facts, tips, and more on your lock screen"
