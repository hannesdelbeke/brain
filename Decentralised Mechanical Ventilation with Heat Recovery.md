a [[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]] for 1 room. Unlike the MVHR that has 1 motor and heat exchane unit for the whole house, a dMVHR has these built in every unit. ([[decentralized]])

It can be easier to install afterwards in a single room, e.g. bathroom since it's [[ductless]]

watch out for 
- noise
- suck in exhaust air
- less filters on incoming air compared to centralized MVHR?

- dmev is loud
- [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TChYcSSNXrI) doesn't recommend dMVHR because they need to be in pairs, are expensive.


similarly decentralized & ductless, like a [[mini split]]
