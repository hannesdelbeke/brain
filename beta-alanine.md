Vegetarians can get **beta-alanine** through foods that contain **carnosine precursors**, though direct sources are limited. Some plant-based foods that contain small amounts include **tofu, edamame, legumes, mushrooms, and asparagus**. However, since beta-alanine is mainly found in animal products, vegetarians rely on their **liver to produce it naturally**.

Interestingly, **exercise itself** can help increase muscle carnosine levels in vegetarians, even without supplementation. While beta-alanine supplements are available, they aren't commonly used unless someone is focused on athletic performance.
