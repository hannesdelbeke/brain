I like this app because it's simple and default included in Windows.

Pros
- native app
- simple to use

Cons
- It requires you to be logged in with a Microsoft account. Might be an issue on some work computers.
- can't customize or hide unused features.
- doesn't work for some business accounts. `your account isn't on exchange online, contact your IT admin`
