# Amazon Simple Queue Service
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables
you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates
the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware,
and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive
messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other
services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS console, Command Line
Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.
SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort
ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are
processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.
