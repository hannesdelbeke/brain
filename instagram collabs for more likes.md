Lately, I've been doing more collaboration posts on [[Instagram]]. (2025-04)
Collab posts have more exposure, leading to more [[liking|likes]].

However, it doesn't seem to lead to more [[followers]],
- Likely because my profile is private, and I don't use public [[hashtag|hashtags]]
- But also because the collab audience mostly consists of private friends from the collaborator. They're only interested in their friend's post, not mine. You mostly meet new friends in person, not over Instagram.
