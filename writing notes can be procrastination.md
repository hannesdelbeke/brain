Note writing is fun, but not efficient.
- feelings of [[fake productivity]]
- I think many of my notes are never reread. 
	- Like how [[Google Photos]] removed free backup, because most selfies were never looked at again.
	- The notes that are reread:
		- Technical details I struggle to remember, often for work.
		- An abstract context that's difficult to remember, e.g. my fleeting [[emotional]] state at a point in time. Emotions are known to be hard to remember correctly.
