Creatinine is a waste product. It is produced by the breakdown of
muscle. Sports people, such as athletes, may therefore have higher
levels than the average person. Creatinine is filtered from the blood
by the [[kidneys]] and removed from the body in the [[urine]]. It is a good
indicator of kidney function and is used in the diagnosis of kidney
disease.
