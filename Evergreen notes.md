Evergreen notes are notes that are meant to be updated over time.
Notes you reread regularly, update with new info, or correct outdated info.

e.g. wikipedia pages

I use evergreen notes for my [[note taking]]
## book example
- Books are an example of permanent notes. They require a certain level of structure and polish, since you can't update them after they're printed.
- A book script is evergreen, you keep updating it until your editor is happy.

- Every evergreen note (organism) can be broken down into a combination of facts, which are permanent notes (atoms) [post](https://anthonyamar.fr/Digital+garden/Atomic+design+applied+to+digital+gardening). The atoms don't change, but the organism does. - [[atomic]]

[[blog|blogs]] & [[book|books]] contain notes that're written once, and never updated afterward.
Whereas a [[digital garden]] aims to be updated, just like how a garden is organic and needs weeding and care over time.
