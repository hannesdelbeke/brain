Evergreen notes are notes that are meant to be updated over time.
e.g. wikipedia pages

I use evergreen notes for my [[note taking]]
## book example
- Books are an example of permanent notes. They require a certain level of structure and polish, since you can't update them after they're printed.
- A book script is evergreen, you keep updating it until your editor is happy.
