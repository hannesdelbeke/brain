When I look at my [[Obsidian graph view]], I notice patterns 
- I color each past job in a different color
- I color public and private notes
- I also color a study course I took

🟦 **The study course** has almost no links to other notes, it lives on the periphery of the graph. This reflects that I barely used any of it in my own life afterwards.

🟩🟥🟧🟪**Work notes** clump together by past job on the periphery. They are more integrated with all other notes, since I write a lot of technical notes that link back to my work notes.

🟨**Personal notes**: The notes that I'm the most passionate about, are at the center of my graph.
	 health & food, technical notes, personal project notes, practical notes about the house and car, ...
The big yellow clump at the center is personal [[journaling]], the rest is like the glue connecting everything together.

🔲**Public notes**
These notes are formatted to share with others. No private data, better formatting, ...
I often reference them, and have 75% of the whole vault public as of 2026-02. The facts & findings I want to share with the world, is the glue connecting all my notes.

I don't often look at the graph, but found it interesting that patterns appeared after a year of use.
