Unlimited photo storage
[[Amazon Prime]] members get unlimited full-resolution photo storage and 5 GB for video from Amazon Photos. Not a Prime member? Everyone gets 5 GB for photos and videos.

## Free limit & enforcement
If you are no longer a Prime member, your Amazon Photos storage is limited to 5 GB for both photos and videos. If you exceed this limit, you can still view, download, and delete files, but you cannot upload any new ones until you are under the 5 GB limit. After 180 days with an "over-quota" status, Amazon will start deleting your most recent uploads to bring your account back into compliance, but you will be notified beforehand.
