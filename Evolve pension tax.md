Crystal operates a ‘net pay’ arrangement, meaning your contributions are taken out of your earnings before they are taxed. (AFAIK this is [[SMART salary sacrifice]])
As your pension contribution reduces your earnings subject to tax, you receive your full amount of tax relief straightaway via [[Pay As You Earn|PAYE]] (unless you earn less than the tax threshold, please see the section above ‘What if I don’t pay tax’).
Your pension contribution does not reduce the amount of your wages that are subject to National Insurance Contributions (NI).

# example
For Example (Monthly Income):
A member receives basic pay of £2,500 a month before tax
They make pension contributions of 5% and receive an employer contribution of 3%.

|                                     |              |     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | --- |
| BASIC PAY                           | £ 2,500      |     |
| EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION (£2,500 X 5%) | - £ 125      |     |
|                                     | £2,375       |     |
| PERSONAL ALLOWANCE 2019/20 TAX YEAR | - £ 1,041.67 |     |
|                                     | £ 1,333.33   |     |
| INCOME TAX £1,333.33 X 20%)         | - £ 266.67   |     |
|                                     | £ 1,066.66   |     |
| ADD PERSONAL ALLOWANCE BACK         | £1,041.67    |     |
| ESTIMATED NI                        | - £ 214      |     |
| NET PAY £                           |  1,894.33    |     |
In this example, if no pension contribution was made, then the tax on income would have been £291.67. The level of tax relief achieved amounts to £25.00 meaning the cost of a £125.00 contribution to the member amounts to £100.00.
If your pension contributions are paid via [[salary sacrifice]] by your employer, then tax relief on a ‘net pay’ arrangement does not apply. You won't pay tax or National Insurance on the sacrificed part of your annual salary.
