features
- Save searches
- a [[tool launcher]] for tools added to the menu
	- You can't create tool/command categories. The closest alternative is sub menus and saving your search.
	- The unity menu doesn't support thumbnails, so neither does this searcher
	- You can [[favorite|star]] results/tools. Favorited items always show at the top of a search.
	  There's no easy way to see favorites unless you do a search containing that favorite.
	  Favorited items can be accessed with [SearchSettings.searchItemFavorites](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Search.SearchSettings-searchItemFavorites.html)
