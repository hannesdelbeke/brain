Barbiturates are a class of [[central nervous system]] depressant drugs that were once commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. They are known for their sedative and hypnotic properties, making them effective at reducing anxiety and promoting sleep. While they were once widely used, their use has declined due to the risk of overdose and the development of safer alternatives, such as [[benzodiazepines]]
