Until recently the trickle vent in my girlfriend's small office was always closed. 
She [[work from home|works from home]] 8 hours a day in a small room, closes the door while working, and has not much [[ventilation]].
She wanted to keep it closed, but I convinced her to open it at least a bit.

A [[co2 monitoring|CO2 reading]] [1] with the vent slightly open reported 1650 ppm
This level of poor air quality leads to 
- Chronic tiredness
- reduced Cognitive performance

Now we'll open the trickle vent to the max, and see how this makes a difference.
- [ ] follow up with new reading.
