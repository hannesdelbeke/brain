subtle and informal responses a listener gives during a speaker's turn, indicating their engagement and understanding. These responses can be verbal (e.g., "uh-huh," "yeah") or non-verbal (e.g., head nods), and they primarily serve to show the listener's attention rather than conveying significant information.
