As a [[technical artist]], there's a high likelyhood you will join a messy project.
No naming conventions, or folder structure, etc.
### How to handle being dumped in a messy project.

- create a quick validator script
  give it to artists and ensure it saves them time!
  They will start to come to you for more.
- create a batcher, to batch validate several scenes.
  first dogfood your own tool, then give it to artists.
  It will save them lots of time
  
- always assume everything will be broken.
  don't rely on things in your code to be setup in a certain way.
  create visual feedback. red broken, green good.
  
- establish a process.
  work with producers to ensure content is created in the same way. coming from the same place.
  Who is currently working on that asset? Is there a Kanban board? What if the asset is handed over to another team? Can the asset be in different states on 2 separate boards?
