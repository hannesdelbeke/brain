atm [[Unity]] doesn't support the go back button on the mouse to navigate selection

best workaround
- github [repo](https://github.com/wappenull/unity-cutcopypaste-nav) for a [[Unity tool]] with navigation: back&  forward, and up & down folder.
  Tested & works
	- [ ] ideal would be, instead of alt arrow, use mouse back button
	      might be able to do this with extra script? or change unity preferences

- [request](https://discussions.unity.com/t/will-unity-editor-ever-have-a-back-button/1522767) on forum for back button (2024)
- [script](https://discussions.unity.com/t/editor-forward-back-buttons-editor-script/937664) that adds buttons to inspector to go back to previous selections
- unity forum [post](https://discussions.unity.com/t/can-we-get-a-back-button-in-the-project-panel/753510/6) with download to back & forward button in inspector (2020)
- github [repo](https://github.com/creativitRy/UnityProjectBrowserHistory) back & forward button 2018, only works in 2 panel mode
- github [repo](https://github.com/garettbass/UnityExtensions.SelectionHistory) selection back & forward commands (2019)
	- adds to menu, mouse, and buttons. includes nice documentation
	- [report](https://github.com/garettbass/UnityExtensions.SelectionHistory/issues/2) of some code issues 
third party [repo](https://github.com/acoppes/unity-history-window), no mouse navigation, but a editor window 
- select asset (this is added to the selection history tab)
- go to the selection history tab and  select the previous asset
