atm [[Unity]] doesn't support the go back button on the mouse to navigate selection

current workaround
third party tool https://github.com/acoppes/unity-history-window
- select asset (this is added to the selection history tab)
- go to the selection history tab and  select the previous asset

ideal would be
- select asset
- click "go back" button on mouse to select previous asset, see [[most recent UX]]

- [request](https://discussions.unity.com/t/will-unity-editor-ever-have-a-back-button/1522767) on forum for back button (2024)
- [script](https://discussions.unity.com/t/editor-forward-back-buttons-editor-script/937664) that adds buttons to inspector to go back to previous selections
- unity forum [post](https://discussions.unity.com/t/can-we-get-a-back-button-in-the-project-panel/753510/6) with download to back & forward button in inspector (2020)
- github [repo](https://github.com/creativitRy/UnityProjectBrowserHistory) back & forward button 2018, only works in 2 panel mode
- github [repo](https://github.com/garettbass/UnityExtensions.SelectionHistory) selection back & forward commands (2019)
	- adds to menu, mouse, and buttons. includes nice documentation
