The [[Maya plugin manager]] enables the user to enable plugins.
It shows the name & path of a plugin,
but it doesn't show what the plugin does.
Many default plugins have cryptic names.

It would be great to have a UI, that lets you enable plugins etc. But that also shows you plugin information.
> e.g. This is the fbx export plugin. Enabling this will add a fbx option in the export dropdown, which can be found in the menu `File/export`
