when installing a [[Blender addon]], in a addon path, Blender won't detect it if the addon path didn't exist on startup.

to fix, add path manually when creating it
sometimes only a restart will fix it.

- [[plugget]] blender installers (attempt to) handle this
- path issue causing this bug https://github.com/plugget/plugget-blender-addon/issues/11
