Glasp seems great for taking notes, but not for importing in Obsidian.
## cons
- not easy to import notes to Obsidian
	- You either download 1 note, or all notes. 
	  If you have thousands of notes this is wasted bandwidth
	- You need to manually download notes, this means you don't own your data, since most users wont do this regularly. Just like downloading all your facebook or google data.
- no support to export notes
	- No option to edit highlights in Obsidian, then export them back to Glasp to see them in the web.
## suggested
The perfect workflow would have a plugin in Obsidian to auto sync notes. And support note editing in Obsidian.

PS: Glasp has daily Notion sync / export. Daily is too slow, and it's not clear if sync includes edits in Notion.
