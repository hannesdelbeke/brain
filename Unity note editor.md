A [[Unity tool|Unity editor tool]] to add [[note taking|notes]] to assets

https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unity-note-editor

Once I start using this more, todo:
- [x] add edit/view (rich text) support
- [x] add URL & asset link support
- [x] [[Unity local|private/local]] notes support 
	- [ ] support a list of note repos. e.g. 1 for direct team, 1 private, 1 for everyone
- [x] [[Unity extend right click context menu|right-click]] an asset to generate & copy the link. 

can be combined with [[Unity deeplink RnD]] for URLs to select other unity assets
