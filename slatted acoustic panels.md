- [thread](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/acoustic-treatment-with-slats-before-and-after-measurements.42559/) discussing if it actually works, lots of audiophiles believe it's not great
- You could improve the performance massively and quite cheaply, by adding a 5-10cm gap behind filled with mineral wool
- true acoustic wood slats need to be much deeper, at least 3-4 inches (no fact source)
- this mainly helps reduce echo ("clap your hands" test), helps improve audibility of dialogue and reduce sibilance. Whereas rockwool reduces reverb time of lower frequencies, too.
