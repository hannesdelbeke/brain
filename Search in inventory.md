Crafting games let you build chests, to store items. 
Players want to keep everything, so they build lots of chests.
They then create their own system to organise items, which takes a lot of time

Would it make sense to add a search feature.
or does this disengage the player, since spending time organizing connects them with the game, it's playtime.
