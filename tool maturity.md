a reference list when making a tool

- [ ] [[restore last session]]
- [ ] the tool has documentation [[TODO how to write good documentation]]
- [ ] [[tool documentation button]]
- [ ] updating the tool is easy
- [ ] rolling back a problematic installed tool update is easy
- [ ] the tool still works when other code has issues, e.g. project in [[Unity]] has a bug
- [ ] prevent multiple windows being opened, instead close the previous session and open a new one.
