# AWS Outposts
AWS Outposts bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data
center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. You can use the same APIs, the same tools, the same
hardware, and the same functionality across on-premises and the cloud to deliver a truly consistent
hybrid experience. Outposts can be used to support workloads that need to remain on-premises due to
low latency or local data processing needs.
AWS Outposts come in two variants: 1) VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts allows you to use the same
VMware control plane and APIs you use to run your infrastructure, 2) AWS native variant of AWS
Outposts allows you to use the same exact APIs and control plane you use to run in the AWS cloud, but
on-premises.
AWS Outposts infrastructure is fully managed, maintained, and supported by AWS to deliver access to
the latest AWS services. Getting started is easy, you simply log into the AWS Management Console to
order your Outposts servers, choosing from a wide range of compute and storage options. You can order
one or more servers, or quarter, half, and full rack units.
