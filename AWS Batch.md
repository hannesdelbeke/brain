# AWS Batch
AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of
thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity
and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory-optimized instances) based on the volume and
specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install
and manage batch computing software or server clusters that you use to run your jobs, allowing you
to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch plans, schedules, and runs your batch
computing workloads across the full range of AWS compute services and features, such as [[Amazon EC2]] and Spot Instances.
