**Key Findings:**
- Athletes in athletics, basketball, boxing, equestrian sports, and wrestling had significantly shorter lives, [according to the NIH](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38180004/). 
- Olympic achievement was more strongly linked to length of life in individual sports than in team sports, [according to the NIH](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38180004/). 
- **Olympians, in general, outlived the general population by about 3.4 years**

> [!NOTE]
> pole vaulting was associated with an 8.4-year extension in lifespan, 
> gymnastics was linked to an 8.2-year extension

Olympic medalists' lifespan was shorter than non-medalists
boxing, weightlifting, ice hockey, cycling, football, swimming, and wrestling

the duration of life in athletes involved in these disciplines was highest
athletics, rowing, fencing, artistic gymnastics, shooting, cross-country skiing, sailing, and equestrian sports

**Conclusions**
Disciplines engaging mostly power link to shorter [[lifespan|lifespans]],
Disciplines involving predominantly skill associate with longer life durations.

> [!warning]
> 1. Within the elite athlete population, skill-based athletes live the longest.
>    But the study does not compare athletes to the general population (non-athletes).
> 2. The link only matters for individual sports, this conclusion doesn't apply to team sports

(link only matters for individual sports, this conclusion doesn't apply to team sports)
