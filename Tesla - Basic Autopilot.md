Basic Autopilot includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.
- **Traffic-Aware Cruise Control**: 
  Maintains your speed and an adjustable following distance from the vehicle in front of you, if there is one (see [Traffic-Aware Cruise Control](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_eu/GUID-20F2262F-CDF6-408E-A752-2AD9B0CC2FD6.html#GUID-842DBF70-E101-4250-8CA5-DCE6135D7149)).
- **Autosteer**:
  Maintains your speed and distance from a leading vehicle while also intelligently keeping Model 3 in its lane (see [Autosteer](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_eu/GUID-20F2262F-CDF6-408E-A752-2AD9B0CC2FD6.html#GUID-E006C4C8-C0CB-4819-BD02-AE34C936025F)).

> [!warning]
> Basic Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury, or death.
