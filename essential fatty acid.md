Essential fatty acids must be obtained from food, the body can't make them. (just like [[essential amino acids]])

Some excellent sources of [[alpha-linolenic acid|omega-3]] and [[linoleic acid|Omega-6]] essential fatty acids are [[fish]], flaxseed oil, hemp, walnuts, and leafy vegetables

There are two categories of essential fatty acids: omega-3 and omega-6.

Although it is possible for plant food acids to be converted to essential fatty acids. the conversion levels are below 10% and not sufficient ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12936959))
Compared to meat eaters, **vegans have 53% lower levels of EPA and nearly 59% lower levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]** ([2](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/2/327.full.pdf+html)).
