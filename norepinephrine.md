You want a [[the Goldilocks effect|Goldilocks]] amount that's just enough to keep you going. Too much can cause [[anxiety]] while too little brings on symptoms of [[depression]].

[[caffeine]] promotes the release of norepinephrine which can increase heart rate and [[blood pressure]] in some individuals. For most people this is well tolerated, but for others it may lead to palpitations or extra beats from the heart

As a medication, norepinephrine is used to increase and maintain [[blood pressure]] in limited, short-term serious health situations.
