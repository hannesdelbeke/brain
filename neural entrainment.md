I'm unsure about the Neural entrainment claim from the book [[supercommunicators]], I've not yet seen research that backs up this claim.

> It claims when we communicate well, our brainwaves sync. The same happens with people in a concert. This is neural entrainment: eyes dilate in tandem, your pulse matches, and you can complete each other's sentences in your head.
