When I started out with game development, I used to develop [[my games]]  on dropbox.
A few issues with that:
- data limit of 2gb for free tier
- if a project is 500 mb, this will count towards everyoneâ€™s free 2gb limit. So if someone has done a few gamejams already, they now can't join.
- the unity library is also uploaded. this should usually be excluded from your version control, e.g. with a git ignore on [[git]], or a perforce ignore on [[Perforce]]
