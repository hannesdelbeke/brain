The neoHub is the gateway to the neoStat system, there’s no need for port forwarding or dynamic DNS, simple plug and play, no fuss. NeoHub is compatible with all Neo series models, neoStat, neoStat-e, neoStat-hw, neoAir and neoPlug. Compatible with Apple Homekit allowing full integration with your other Homekit accessories. 

**Local Control**- Should the internet connection fail, the heating system can still be operated within the home by using the thermostat keypad. As soon as the internet connection is restored, your neoHub will automatically logon to the Cloud Server re-enabling app control. 

**Multi-Zone**- The Heatmiser Neo Network system has been built from the ground up with multi-zone homes in mind. The neoHub coordinates the data between each neoStat thermostat on the network. 

**Plug and Play**- The neoHub connects directly to a spare port on your router, obtaining an I.P. Address and joining itself to your home network. It has been designed to be simple to install and setup, and is compatible with broadband connections with Dynamic I.P. Addresses. The neoHub connects to a Cloud Server eliminating any complex setup requirements including port forwarding.
