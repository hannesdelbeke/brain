A [[book]] about the traits of good communicators. It uses stories of people overcoming difficult situations with the use of great [[communication]] skills.
## Summary
3 key insights from the book
- The goal of a meaningful [[conversation]] is connection
- Most of our conversations fall into [[3 conversation categories]]
- Being a **supercommunicator** means asking more questions
## ask questions
- Good communicators can steer conversations (and allegedly create [[neural entrainment]])
- they're not the loudest, but enable others to speak and feel heard. They're facilitators. Having them in groups makes the group much more effective.
- Before speaking, they ask "why am i speaking?", they speak with purpose
- ask 10-20 times more questions
	- [[asking more questions leads to more social connections]]
## build connections
good communicators build trust in a conversation with
- Ask [[deep questions|deep]] and [[open-ended question|open-ended questions]]
	- [[turn shallow questions into deep questions]]
- [[active listening]]: use [[backchanneling]] to show you're listening
- [[mirroring]]
	- [[match energy in a conversation]] (mood & tone)
	- match emotions: reciprocate when someone shares feelings 
	- use [[body language]] and tone of voice (energy?)
- **Always** try to [[reciprocate]] when someone shares personal details and ask [[follow-up question|follow-up questions]].
- ask others about needs and feelings, and explore identities related to the conversation.
- be easy to read
	- Share your goals
	- use expressive [[body language]]
	- Avoid sarcasm and direct criticism, especially online

Strong connections have a positive impact on our lives:
