i have lots of files on various locations
hard drive, dropbox, github, ...

My game projects are spread between multiple locations. I'm moving them all to github and created an overview in [[my games]]

My 3d projects are also spread. 
- [ ] no solution yet

My images are currently on HDD, PC, google drive, instagram.
But how much do i care about these?
[[try photo backup services]]
- [ ] use amazon photos as a phone pic only backup system?

it doesn't make sense to use multiple backupsystems.
would it be possible to move everything to 1 system?
e.g. a data lake.

could move everything to a single folder. then use shortcuts to create folders by category.
this requires everything to be accessible. (unless virtual drive like dropbox)
