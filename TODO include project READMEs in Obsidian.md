Many of my projects have their own README files, formatted to show on [[GitHub]].
And I create mirror pages in Obsidian.

It'd be cool if creating a mirror page was optional, and I could see, and edit, all my READMEs in Obsidian. - [[use more links in life]]

Idea 1: 
Clone all repos under a repo folder in Obsidian, now I can link to all READMEs.
Git cloning would require me to have all projects cloned, or some links might break.
Bonus: I now can also link to code files in my projects.
CON
- Need to figure out how to exclude projects from Obsidian's git management, it would clash with my WIP git states during development

Idea 2:
A script that only downloads all READMEs, instead of cloning all projects.
It could run on startup, or trigger manually.
CON: 
- How to handle editing README in Obsidian, and uploading back to git?
	- consider read-only?
