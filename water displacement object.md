When I take a [[bath]], it feels wasteful. The bath is too big and uses too much water.

If I could put something in the bath I'd save water, and the water would be higher, so I'd feel more cozy.

Someone else [thought of this already](https://www.designboom.com/design/water-displacement-objects-by-rochus-jacob-iida-awards-2010/), and created a non-porous plastic pebble to do this.

Other DIY solutions, that don't look stylish
- glass bottles filled with water
- stones from the beach. Might be porous or scratch

To save more [[water]], we can expand on this idea and bath in a human shaped mold.
