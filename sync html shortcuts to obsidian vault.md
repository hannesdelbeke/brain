we can create html shortcuts in our [[Obsidian vault|vault]]. kinda like what [[google drive]] does.
[[embed Google Drive folder in Obsidian]]

- auto works with obsidian autocomplete, since it's just a file in the vault.
- we can set up separate syncers, strava, github, [[google contacts]], ...

cons
- but it's not yet a personal data link system. it only focusses on Obsidian

[[2026-02-21 example sync contact scenario]]
google contacts uses a UID. can we use aliases for non obsidian files?

The only thing this would achieve, is creating a nickname for a URL.
and track [[Obsidian backlinks]]. However we can't see backlinks for files that you can't open in [[Obsidian]]
The note [[note linking duplicate source]] describes this same issue for websites.

But we can open URLs in Obsidian, so if you log in you could see backlinks in the side panel. However atm Obsidian doesn't has the best browsing experience.
And I can't log in my google account in Obsidian.

An external browser app to show backlinks would be better. It could also work with other apps like my [[integrated development environment|IDE]].
