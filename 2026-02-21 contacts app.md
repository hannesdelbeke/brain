I almost only use [[Google contacts]] to look up
- address
- phone number
- (rarely email, since auto complete in [[Gmail]] does that)

But [[google contacts]] is a bit slow in the browser. It can take time to load.
A local contacts app would solve that.
But then links to contacts in our notes would only work if that app is installed, and likely not on let's say our android.

You can also store birthdays, but i don't use it atm.
but showing it on the calendar is overwhelming with hundreds of contacts.
so instead i disable it, and make a new calendar where i add close friends.
it would be useful if I could filter
