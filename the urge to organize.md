It's always addicting to [[categorize|categorize]]/[[organisation|organize]] everything
to write notes for everything

pros
- it gives you (a sense of) control
- it makes it easier in the future to do certain things

cons
- but it's often a waste of time, spending more time organizing than future time saved
- it's addicting and satisfying, just like how ticking a checkbox is.
- it might give a false sense of [[productivity]]

examples
- e.g. a runner who tracks their 200m walk to the pub
  they likely don't need this data, but feel satisfation from tracking everything
- making a note for everything, i do this often, even for mundane things
