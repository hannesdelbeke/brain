The MenACWY vaccine is given as an injection in the upper arm. 
It's recommended for young people, who are at a higher risk of getting meningococcal disease. The vaccine is also recommended for people with no spleen or a spleen that doesn't work properly, Hajj pilgrims, and travelers to countries with high rates of meningococcal disease.

While the MenACWY vaccine is very effective, it's not 100% effective. It's still important to know the signs and symptoms of [[meningitis]] and septicaemia, even if you or your child are vaccinated. Symptoms can come on quickly, and early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are vital.
