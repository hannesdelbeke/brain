An extractor fan is classed as an Inductive load which is the same for a tumble dryer and washing machine.
If you want to use a smart device on the fan you need to use something like a [shelly 1pm zwave version](https://shellystore.co.uk/product/shelly-qubino-wave-1pm/) 

**YOU MUST GET THIS WITH IT**

The RC snubber is super cheap but it is required when using shelly devices with Inductive loads as it will soak up the voltage spike from the motor.
