# AWS VPN
AWS Virtual Private Network solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks,
remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network. AWS VPN is comprised of two services: AWS
Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN. Each service provides a highly-available, managed, and elastic
cloud VPN solution to protect your network traffic.
AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted tunnels between your network and your Amazon Virtual Private
Clouds or AWS Transit Gateways. For managing remote access, AWS Client VPN connects your users to
AWS or on-premises resources using a VPN software client.
