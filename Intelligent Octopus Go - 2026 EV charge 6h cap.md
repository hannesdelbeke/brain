## 2026 - EV charge 6h cap  
2026 [[Intelligent Octopus Go]] caps EV charging to 6h/day  
home is not capped, so possible to get up to 12h off peak

- 6h during day while EV charges,
- and the night offpeak. 1130pm-530am

the first 6 hours of smart charging will be at [[off-peak]], and the last one billed at peak rate regardless of what time of the day it is scheduled.
