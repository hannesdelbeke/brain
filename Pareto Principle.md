2 ways to interpret this
- focus on what matters, invest more in the 20% that produces the most results.
- or bring stability by making the 80% more productive

- 80 percent of output is produced by 20 percent of input
- 80 percent of outcomes are from 20 percent of causes

- Often the optimal ratio is closer to 90:10, or even 99:1.
- The more extreme the ratio, then the more at risk the overall business is. 
- doesn't has to add up to 100, e.g. 15% of the business could generate 99% of the revenue

- bring swift and easy clarity to complex situations and problems
	- especially when deciding where to focus effort and resources.
