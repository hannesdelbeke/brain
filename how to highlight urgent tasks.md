## Context
some tasks, e.g. tax return, are only for a year from now.
Set a reminder in the calendar, and hopefully you'll do it then.
But the closer to the deadline the more important they become

How can you [[visualize|visualize]] this in planning?

What about the opposite.
A task with no deadline, but the longer it's not done, the more important it becomes?
e.g. a request from your manager, might become more damaging for your career the longer it's not done.
How to visualize this?
- add a priority score every day
- show a task list ordered by priority

It also would be easier if everything was in 1 system, see [[unify tasklists]]
## goal
become more [[productivity|productive]] and better at [[planning]]
