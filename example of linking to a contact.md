I browse through my memories, and see a picture of my [[friend]] Jack.
I click on the link to my friend, and he shows up in my contact list.
I can click his [[Instagram]] handle to go to his page, or his [[WhatsApp]] to call him.
I can also see all notes where i mentioned him in [[Obsidian]]

I'm describing a [[Linktree]] hub with [[app URI]] links that open apps.

It also would be nice to be able to instead of link to the linktree hub page.
Be able to link directly to an app, e.g. I went on a run with Jack. And link run to the Strava activity.

But later on I might want to add a description or note to the strava activity.
*In our case, strava actually supports private notes. so syncing strava activities to our vault could be an option.* 
- see [[2026-02-22 strava link with note as middleman]]

If I add a description in between, I add a [[wrapper note]] in between.
