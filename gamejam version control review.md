1. A lot of [[gamejam]] suffered from dropbox for version control, see [[avoid developing Unity projects on Dropbox]]. 
2. Later projects used git, but people (including myself) didn't knew how to resolve merges, and were to busy hacking the game together, So we often ended parsing files with a USB stick or over email.
3. Now I'm more experienced I use git, and help the team if they need tech support.
