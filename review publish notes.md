spend a whole day today on setting up auto publishing notes. Most time was spent on tweaking CSS to try get makedocs to work in a dark theme.
I wasted hours on this and it still needs more work.
- code looks bad, e.g. [Blender addon](https://hannesdelbeke.github.io/wiki/Blender%20addon/)
- inline code looks bad and cant figure out easy fix, e.g. [My note naming convention](https://hannesdelbeke.github.io/wiki/my%20note%20naming%20convention/) 

- revert to light theme and accept the limits of `read the docs`
- revert to [[MkDocs materials]]
