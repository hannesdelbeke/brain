Sometimes I discover [[orphane note|unlinked notes]] by browsing a folder, or the Obsidian Graph, but mostly they're lost in the undiscoverable void.

Since I'm an advocate of: [[don't overthink note taking]], many of my notes have no links. 
But notes without links can't be discovered!

A [[CICD]] pipeline could auto link all unlinked notes, like a chaotic inbox.
- [ ] ensure it only links public notes in a central public note, and not private notes.
