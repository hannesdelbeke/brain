| [[water‑resistant]] | Shields against light rain/splashes     | Everyday jackets, watches, shoes       | Not suitable for heavy rain or long exposure  |
| [[water‑repellent]] | Coating makes water bead and roll off   | DWR‑treated fabrics                    | Loses effectiveness over time, seams may leak |
| [[waterproof]]      | Impermeable barrier, fully sealed seams | Hiking shells, rain trousers, dry bags | Less breathable, heavier, needs re‑proofing   |
- **Hydrostatic head rating**: Waterproof gear is often tested (e.g., 10,000 mm+ means it withstands heavy rain).
- **Breathability trade‑off**: Waterproof shells protect better but trap more heat/sweat; water‑resistant gear breathes easier.
- **Maintenance matters**: Waterproof fabrics need re‑proofing (DWR sprays/washes) to stay effective.
