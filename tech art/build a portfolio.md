Collect all work you ever did, including school/uni assignments.
Spare time passion projects are great!
Then filter and keep only the best.

Google a few portfolios in the same field as you are applying.
e.g. stylized junior 3d environment artist
Find some nice references and break down what makes them stand out compared to other portfolios you have seen.

## Everything needs to have a purpose.
A good Maya script on your folio shows the viewer that you know 
- Maya
- Python in Maya
- solving a particular problem
- understanding UX, a nice workflow for artists with simple UI

However a bad folio entry shows the viewer that you don't know something.
	e.g. You're not aware that the UX of your tool is bad, because you put it on your portfolio. Which means it is one of your best pieces.
If you're aware of an issue with a folio piece, try to fix it.
Future employees see the same issue and it'll cost you the job during an interview.

Depending on the role you apply for, it often is better to show less.
When applying for a generalist role, it's better to show lots of work in different fields. 2D, 3D, animation, modelling, game engine, scripting, ...
When applying for a specialist role, this can be seen as a negative. And often it's better to only show the work you are applying for.
e.g. someone applying for a 3D environment art role, might be rejected if they have a lot of characters on their portfolio. Since the studio might think that the artist will jump ship as soon as they get a character art role offered.
[[generalist vs specialist in Indie vs AAA]]

## Finished work is worth a lot
Integrating your model in a 3d engine, shows you can deliver finished work.
Releasing your script online as open source, and getting user feedback, shows you can finish a tool, and work with users.
These are real life work skills that companies are looking for.

Preferably, do not put work you made while following a tutorial on your portfolio. It comes across as junior. A better approach is to [[apply new knowledge]]
