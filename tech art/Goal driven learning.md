## Goal driven learning
It often is easier to set a goal, and then break down what you need to learn.

e.g. I want a tool that automates skin transfer between 2 rigs that live on [[Perforce]].
So I need to learn Blender, Python, how to use Python in Blender, and [[Perforce]].
I already know Blender and [[Perforce]], but I don't know Python and how to use it in Blender. 

Now I know what to learn, and I have a purpose for it. 

Once I've learned Python, I can apply it on my tool in Blender, in ways the Python tutorials didn't teach me directly. By applying my knowledge in new ways, I show myself I truly understand it, and will remember it better. 
I'm not just following a tutorial brainlessly, forgetting everything a week later.

## Prepare for real life
On the job, you often need this mentality. 
There likely won't be a tutorial for the problem you need to fix.
Instead you will be required to combine all your past experience and come up with a new solution.
Learning to break down a problem and tackling it piece by piece is a great skill.
