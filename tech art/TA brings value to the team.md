## TA brings value to the team
The goal is to create & release a product.
Things that help with this bring value, everything else removes value.

A TA either brings value 
- where neither artist or developer can on their own. 
- by helping other team members to bring more value
  e.g. by making them more efficient.
  When a TA makes 5 artists 3x more efficient, then the company gets the value of an additional 10 artists for the cost of 1 TA salary. You can imagine the impact of a small TA team in a studio with hundreds of artists.
