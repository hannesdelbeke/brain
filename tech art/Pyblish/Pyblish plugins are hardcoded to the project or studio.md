### Plugins are hardcoded to the project or studio
Most plugins found online are not reusable, but hardcoded to the project.
They only work with other plugins compatible with the project.
This is because they rely on the context.

Which results in everyone reinventing the wheel for every new project. Even within the same studio, you  likely would have to modify the code from plugins when reusing validation  plugins between project.

can't reuse plugins without editing code in several places (python plugin scripts)
