#### Confusing [[Pyblish]] docs
- Several docs in multiple places, which sometimes contain conflicting info.
	- https://api.pyblish.com/
	- [legacy api](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish.api/wiki) 
	- https://learn.pyblish.com/
	- https://pyblish.gitbooks.io/developer-guide/content/
	- some of above links have multiple versions
- Docs are not maintained.
  While digging through the source code I found some undocumented features (e.g. [filter](https://learn.pyblish.com/24-filtering)) (which were great, and allowed me to make [[Pyblish plugin manager]] ) When I contributed back to the docs, I was told this was the first external contribution in 5 years.
