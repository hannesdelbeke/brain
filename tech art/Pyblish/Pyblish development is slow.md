Any major refactoring takes a lot of effort to get implemented.

- a large codebase that grew over years, with not optimal infrastructure.
- to maintain backwards compatibility, merging in changes is actively discouraged. Since changes could break things. This results in old bad code.
- no changes make it in without unit test, which I'm neutral about.
- it's not Mottosso's prime focus so development is slow
