Pyblish let's you create content pipelines, and is aimed at VFX & games.
It's a plugin based system, that's dcc independent, so you can use the same pipeline in different apps, such as [[Autodesk 3ds Max|max]], ,maya, [[Blender]], substance, â€¦

It's great especially for validation, so artists can run the tool and it will tell them what's wrong with their file.

Pyblish is created around the concept of plugins:
- collector plugins collect instances, which are saved in the context
	  (e.g. collect meshes) 
- validator plugins validate instances
	  (e.g. the mesh has no n-gons)
- extraction plugins export instances
	  (e.g. export the mesh from dcc to disk)
- integration plugins handle various integrations
	  (e.g. update Jira or the CMS for the mesh) 

The plugin workflow is very powerful, allowing for the creation of a more modular pipeline. Whereas the traditional gamedev pipeline is often unique for each studio and hardcoded to the project, making it hard to reuse.

Pyblish has it's root in the VFX industry, so some bits are not 100% straightforward for gamedev.
It's mainly developed by 1 person, Marcus. (I've done some PRs too)
