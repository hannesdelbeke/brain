Fabric is a high level Python (2.7, 3.4+) library designed to execute shell commands remotely over SSH, yielding useful Python objects in return. It builds on top of
- [Invoke](https://pyinvoke.org/) (subprocess command execution and command-line features)
- [Paramiko](https://paramiko.org/) (SSH protocol implementation)
extending their APIs to complement one another and provide additional functionality.
