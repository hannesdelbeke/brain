Pick a single 3d software and stick to it, until you join a studio.
Then adopt the 3d package of the studio and master that.
It's better to be a good modeler in 1 app, than to know all the 3d packages.

The most common 3d packages for modelling:
| app     | cost |
| ------- | ---- |
| [[Blender]] | Free |
| Maya    | Paid |
| [[Autodesk 3ds Max|Max]]     | Paid |
*Most paid 3d software has trails or educational versions you can use to learn.

Sculpting tends to be more relevant for artists and less for technical artists.
| app      | cost |
| -------- | ---- |
| [[Blender]]  | Free |
| ZBrush   | paid |
| Mudbox   | paid |
| Sculptris | Free |
ZBrush is currently the industry standard app for sculpting
