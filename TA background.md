## TA background
Usually a tech artist comes from an art background, sometimes from programming.
They first learned 1 field of game-dev, e.g. animation.
Then they branched out into other fields becoming more generalist. e.g. learn scripting and shaders.
Often after some time, TAs specialize again. e.g. a TA that came from a 3D generalist background who knows how to script, might specialize in [[pipeline]].
