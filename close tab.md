A lot of apps let you close the active [[tab]] with ctrl+W
e.g. [[Chrome]], [[Obsidian]], [[PyCharm]] and other [[integrated development environment|IDEs]]

[[open previously closed tab]] is a great addition to the close tab pattern. It's similar to [[undo]]

The more apps support this, the more intuitive it becomes.

IDEs keep the window open if no tabs are open
Browsers tend to close the window instead.
