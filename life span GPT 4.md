Increasing human lifespan involves a multifaceted approach combining diet, lifestyle, and potentially [[supplement|supplements]]. Here are some research-supported strategies for extending lifespan:

### Supplements

1. **Vitamin D**: Adequate levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced mortality rates. Supplementation is particularly important for those with limited sun exposure.
2. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish oil, omega-3s can reduce [[inflammation]] and improve cardiovascular health.
3. **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)**: Supports mitochondrial function and has [[antioxidant]] properties, potentially improving heart health and reducing [[oxidative stress]].
4. **Resveratrol**: Found in red wine and grapes, resveratrol has been shown to activate certain genes associated with longevity.
5. **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**: A form of vitamin B3, NR can increase levels of NAD+ in the body, which is involved in cellular repair and [[metabolism]].
6. **Curcumin**: The active compound in turmeric, curcumin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
7. **Magnesium**: Important for many bodily functions, magnesium deficiency is linked to various chronic diseases.

### Lifestyle Changes

1. **Regular Physical Activity**: Incorporate both aerobic exercise (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) and resistance training (e.g., weight lifting). Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.
2. **Healthy Diet**: Follow a balanced vegetarian diet rich in whole foods:
    - **High in Fiber**: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
    - **Rich in Antioxidants**: Berries, nuts, and green leafy vegetables.
    - **Healthy Fats**: Nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil.
    - **Low in Processed Foods**: Minimize intake of refined sugars, trans fats, and highly processed snacks.
3. **Caloric Restriction**: Reducing caloric intake without malnutrition has been shown to extend lifespan in various organisms. Intermittent fasting can also mimic the effects of caloric restriction.
4. **Adequate Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Good sleep hygiene includes maintaining a regular sleep schedule and creating a restful sleep environment.
5. **Stress Management**: Chronic stress negatively impacts health. Practices such as mindfulness, [[meditation]], yoga, and deep breathing exercises can help manage stress levels.
6. **Regular Social Interaction**: Maintaining a small but regular social circle can improve mental health and longevity. Social connections are linked to lower risks of chronic diseases and improved overall well-being.
7. **Avoiding Harmful Habits**: Eliminate smoking and limit alcohol intake.

### Other Factors

1. **Regular Health Screenings**: Early detection of potential health issues can lead to better outcomes. Regular check-ups and screenings appropriate for age and health status are essential.
2. **Mental Stimulation**: Engaging in activities that challenge the brain, such as reading, puzzles, or learning new skills, can help maintain cognitive function.
3. **Hydration**: Ensure adequate water intake, which is essential for all bodily functions and maintaining overall health.
4. **Maintaining a Healthy Weight**: Even if not obese, maintaining an optimal weight reduces the risk of many chronic diseases.

### Environmental and Behavioral Considerations

1. **Avoid Environmental Toxins**: Minimize exposure to pollutants, pesticides, and harmful chemicals.
2. **Positive Outlook and Purpose**: Cultivating a positive mindset and having a sense of purpose in life can contribute to longevity.

### Conclusion

Combining these strategies can help promote a longer and healthier life. It's important to note that individual responses to supplements and lifestyle changes can vary, so it's advisable to consult with healthcare professionals before making significant changes to your regimen.
