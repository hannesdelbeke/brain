I wrote a tool to add notes to folders in unity.
https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unity-folder-notes
## alternatives
this can also be achieved with a README textfile in the folder, but it can't be editted from within unity by default.
consider adding a custom inspector for this.

this can also be achieved with a gameobject in each folder. and [[Unity - add notes to gameobjects]]
