I wrote a tool to add notes to folders in unity.
https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unity-folder-notes
# todo
- [ ] support [[Unity search]]. Â e.g. for a [class Comments](https://gist.github.com/kurtdekker/e63690a1bfe9515d40d3f09a1470daba) you can search `t:comments`
- [ ] support [[URL]], [[wikilink]], [[Markdown]]
## alternatives
this can also be achieved with a README textfile in the folder, but it can't be editted from within unity by default.
consider adding a custom inspector for this.

this can also be achieved with a gameobject in each folder. and [[Unity - add notes to gameobjects]]
