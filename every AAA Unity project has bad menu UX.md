every unity project I worked on, has a messy [[menu]] setup.
## The main menu
- multiple teams add their tools to Unity, in different menus.
- multiple people within the same team often disagree where to put their menu entries.
- even if you had a nice structure within your company, third party plugins will put menu entries all over the place.

The end result is absolutely no clue where to find a tool
## The right click menu
Unity also has a right click menu. This menu often has more menu entries than it can fit in the height of the screen, creating a bad user experience search for a menu item.

## The fix
[[Unity search]] allows the user to search for what they need.
- No struggling with similar tools spread between multiple menus, search can find them all. 
- You can create your own "menu collections", by saving a search.
  You can save locally, as a user. Or save it in the project, to share with your team.
