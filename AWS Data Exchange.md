# AWS Data Exchange
AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud. Qualified
data providers include category-leading brands such as Reuters, who curate data from over 2.2 million
unique news stories per year in multiple languages; Change Healthcare, who process and anonymize
more than 14 billion healthcare transactions and $1 trillion in claims annually; Dun & Bradstreet, who
maintain a database of more than 330 million global business records; and Foursquare, whose location
data is derived from 220 million unique consumers and includes more than 60 million global commercial
venues.
Once subscribed to a data product, you can use the AWS Data Exchange API to load data directly into
Amazon S3 and then analyze it with a wide variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services.
For example, property insurers can subscribe to data to analyze historical weather patterns to calibrate
insurance coverage requirements in different geographies; restaurants can subscribe to population and
location data to identify optimal regions for expansion; academic researchers can conduct studies on
climate change by subscribing to data on carbon dioxide emissions; and healthcare professionals can
subscribe to aggregated data from historical clinical trials to accelerate their research activities.
For data providers, AWS Data Exchange makes it easy to reach the millions of AWS customers migrating
to the cloud by removing the need to build and maintain infrastructure for data storage, delivery, billing,
and entitling.
