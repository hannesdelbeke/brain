# Amazon Pinpoint
Amazon Pinpoint makes it easy to send targeted messages to your customers through multiple
engagement channels. Examples of targeted campaigns are promotional alerts and customer retention
campaigns, and transactional messages are messages such as order confirmations and password reset
messages.
You can integrate Amazon Pinpoint into your mobile and web apps to capture usage data to provide you
with insight into how customers interact with your apps. Amazon Pinpoint also tracks the ways that your
customers respond to the messages you sendâ€”for example, by showing you the number of messages
that were delivered, opened, or clicked.
You can develop custom audience segments and send them pre-scheduled targeted campaigns via email,
SMS, and push notifications. Targeted campaigns are useful for sending promotional or educational
content to re-engage and retain your users.
You can send transactional messages using the console or the Amazon Pinpoint REST API. Transactional
campaigns can be sent via email, SMS, push notifications, and voice messages. You can also use the API
to build custom applications that deliver campaign and transactional messages.
