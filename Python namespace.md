[[Python]]
namespace modules are interesting
on paper i love the concept, since it's very [[modular]]

## cons
- but [[PyCharm]] doesnt seem to like them for autocomplete. 
no init, red underline
- chance that you create the same file in 2 folders, resulting in only one being loaded
- it takes more [[cognitive load]] IMO to understand, and to plan your [[software architecture|code architecture]].
