Putting vague ideas on paper after watching the show `Severance`
Not leading to anything concrete
## A ruthless company
There's the argument online, that companies don't care for you.
You should look out for yourself, since they will replace you as soon as it's profitable.
Companies often pretend they care for you, with words like family etc. But HR is often not on your side. And the cringy company pillars are more for show, and feel cult like.

## A caring company
The other side of the coin is a company that cares for its employees. And keeps poor performers employed.
Companies that are ruthless in cutting out anyone who's not a top performer, have better talent density. (But they might miss out on range & diversity)

## Middle ground - feedback
Is there a middle ground?
What if, instead of firing poor performers, you reduce their hours or responsibility.
The worse they perform, the more you reduce it.
The drawback is the emotional impact might not motivate, but depress. Leading to worse work. But instant feedback could lead to instant work improvements too.
This seems it might need a different approach depending on the employee's personality.
This seems similar to PIP. But PIP has a all or nothing. Hired or fired outcome.

- companies often dangle bonuses or promotions, but don't give them
- companies often keep paying large salaries to seniors that have been around for a while, but they might have settled.
- some kind of performance driven reward system would be great, however people would optimize for their short ther performance (money) and not the long term performance of the company/goal
- the only way around it seems to be giving people a stake in the company. 
	- think of that investment company that bought out the stock from their angel investors. Eventually the company was 100% employee owned.
	- but some people would stop giving their all when they made millions

from a personal point of view. i often work harder for tasks i care about, than silly tasks at companies that pay double.
So personal motivation seems the biggest driver. Purpose, knowledge, ...
Manager connection would also impact. Feeling valued, social connections.
Money always does, up to a point. Money is time and power.
Recognition for your achievements.
