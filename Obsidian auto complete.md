When I type a word, predict what I want to write. And let me complete it with tab.

pros
- This increases my [[flow]], I can type fast and create links in seconds.
- It helps with finding notes I forgot about, 
	- when I remember I wrote a note about a subject, I can type in the subject, open it, find the linked note, go back, and insert that note.
	- or when i forgot about a note, but i type in a subject, and an old note shows in the autocomplete list. I check it out and it turns out to be related to my current note. great for [[discovery]]

Just like GMail, or VS-code, or Copilot

Word completion, not sentence prediction.
