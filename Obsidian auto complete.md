When I type a word, predict what I want to write. And let me complete it with tab.

There's 2 types of autocomplete
1. if you type a word, and [[large language model|LLM]] predicts the rest of the word or sentence.
   Inline suggestions, Text prediction
2. if you type `[[` and a dropdown shows notes that start with the letters I type.
	   Similar to the code completion in an IDE, when it shows a list of methods that are exposed on a var when you type `my_var.`

pros
- This increases my [[flow]], I can type fast and create links in seconds.
- It helps with finding notes I forgot about, 
	- when I remember I wrote a note about a subject, I can type in the subject, open it, find the linked note, go back, and insert that note.
	- or when i forgot about a note, but i type in a subject, and an old note shows in the autocomplete list. I check it out and it turns out to be related to my current note. great for [[discovery]]
