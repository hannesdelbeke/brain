an [[extension cord]] for a [[electric vehicle|EV]] needs to ensure it's safe, to avoid an electrical fire.
- don't coil it when in use
- ensure it doesn't get too hot.
- don't use any extension cord, ensure it covers the specs needed and can be used outdoors. (and in rain)
- dont use 2 25ft cables, use 1 50ft cable, because plug connections add significant resistance.
- If you were to use a cable that had a lower max rate than your vehicle, and you plugged it into a charger that was capable of more than the cable could handle, it could create a fire hazard (so if your vehicle does 48A, and you got a 32A cable, and plugged it into a 40A or 48A EVSE, it would be a major fire hazard).

do
- get a higher duty thicker one so there is less resistance on the cord
