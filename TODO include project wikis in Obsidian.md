Just like [[TODO include project READMEs in Obsidian]], but with project wikis instead of READMEs.

e.g. bqt and plugget have wikis. 
These wiki pages are [[Markdown]] files that can be read by [[Obsidian]].
It'd be cool if I could clone and view these notes in Obsidian, so I have 1 central place to manage my knowledge.

CON
- Some [[wikilink|wikilinks]] in my current notes would break, since some wiki pages will share the same name as these notes.
