An [article](https://maggieappleton.com/interoperable-libraries) on the disadvantages of using [[goodreads]] for long term data storage.
It suggests creating interoperable systems where users can publish their book collections in common formats, facilitating data exchange and fostering connections based on shared reading interests. (reading groups)

- suggests data exchange formats
- standards for book data
- explore existing solutions like Schema.org and Library JSON
- ad hoc reading groups from public bookshelves
All of this is not very practical, you need a third party like Goodreads to make this accessible.
