# Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka
(Amazon MSK)
Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) is a fully managed service that makes
it easy for you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data. Apache
Kafka is an open-source platform for building real-time streaming data pipelines and applications.
With Amazon MSK, you can use Apache Kafka APIs to populate data lakes, stream changes to and from
databases, and power machine learning and analytics applications.
Apache Kafka clusters are challenging to setup, scale, and manage in production. When you run Apache
Kafka on your own, you need to provision servers, configure Apache Kafka manually, replace servers
when they fail, orchestrate server patches and upgrades, architect the cluster for high availability, ensure
data is durably stored and secured, setup monitoring and alarms, and carefully plan scaling events to
support load changes. Amazon MSK makes it easy for you to build and run production applications on
Apache Kafka without needing Apache Kafka infrastructure management expertise. That means you
spend less time managing infrastructure and more time building applications.
With a few clicks in the Amazon MSK console you can create highly available Apache Kafka clusters
with settings and configuration based on Apache Kafkaâ€™s deployment best practices. Amazon MSK
automatically provisions and runs your Apache Kafka clusters. Amazon MSK continuously monitors
cluster health and automatically replaces unhealthy nodes with no downtime to your application. In
addition, Amazon MSK secures your Apache Kafka cluster by encrypting data at rest.
