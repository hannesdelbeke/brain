The last few weeks I moved away from categorizing my notes in folders, increasing my [[note taking]] productivity.
(12-05-2024)

I practice [[minimal notetaking]], less is more. This change proved yet again this approach works for me.

## Previous folder workflow
I used to store daily notes in a daily folder, and categorize notes in folders.
I manually move New notes to their category folder.

example:
```
📂programming
	🗒️Python tips.md
📂note taking
	🗒️Obsidian tips.md
📂daily
	🗒️2024-05-11.md
	🗒️2024-05-12.md
```

This looks nice and organised, and makes it easy to find the notes I want.
## The issue
The fastest way of writing new notes is to write [[wikilink]] to non-existing notes. 
Then click the link in [[Obsidian]] to create the note, and instantly start writing the new note.
But this new note is created in the same folder as my current note, inheriting the current category. So if I write a new note for a different category, I have to move it.

Moving every note to a folder takes time and brain power to decide which category they should go in.
Sometimes notes didn't fit in a category and I wasted time trying to figure out where to put them, leading to [[decision fatigue]]

I knew of the single folder solution when I started taking notes, and started to see the benefits over time. Now I bit the bullet.

## Maintain organisation
The more notes I write, the harder it is to organize them. So removing folders seems like a terrible idea?!

How I tend to use my notes is:
- I vaguely know I wrote a note about a subject, so search for the subject in note names. 
- if I can't find it, I search for a related note.

So as long as my notes are well linked to their subjects, I don't need folders.

example: Instead of having all Python notes in a Python folder, all Python notes should be linked to a Python note.

And folders can be replaced with overview notes that link to all notes in the folder (AKA related to the subject.)
## Next steps
I haven't moved everything yet to 1 folder, instead I make all new notes in 1 folder.
Currently the old folders act as some kind of link between all notes inside of it. 
- [ ] I need to make central pages to take over this role before I move out the notes.

PS: In my new setup, new notes can be moved to a `public` or `private` folder [[Obsidian quick move|with the click of a button]].
