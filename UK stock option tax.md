In the UK, [[stock options|options]] aren't taxed when they're granted or fully vested. Instead, **taxation happens at the point of exercise**. 
You pay income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on the difference between the strike price and the share price

# example

| shares  | share price | total     |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 153,125 | $0.115891   | $17,745.8 |
| 153,125 | $0.35       | $49,000   |

You're granted 153,125 shares at $0.115891 per share. Total $17,745.8
The stock increases in value to 0.35/share (total $49k)

So you made $31,254.2 profit, even though you can't sell the shares until IPO.

You pay 45% income tax on $31,254.2 = $14k

spent so far $17,7k + 14k tax = 31,7k
## no IPO
loss $31,700
## IPO
let's say no increase in value
spent  31,7k
capital gains allowance first £6,000
when you sell the stock, 20% capital gain tax on $43k = 8,600
spent total  $40,300
profit $9000

let's say increase value, then it's all profit with 20% tax
