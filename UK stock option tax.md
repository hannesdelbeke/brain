In the UK, [[stock options|options]] aren't taxed when they're granted or fully vested. Instead,Â **taxation happens at the point of exercise**. 
You pay income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on the difference between the strike price and the share price

example

| shares  | share price | total     |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 153,125 | $0.115891   | $17,745.8 |
| 153,125 | $0.35       | $49,000   |

You're granted 153,125 shares at $0.115891 per share. Total $17,745.8
The stock increases in value to 0.35/share (total $49k)

So you made $31,254.2 profit, even though you can't sell the shares until IPO.

You pay 45% income tax = $14,000
then when you sell the stock, you pay capital gain tax
