In the UK, [[stock options|options]] aren't taxed when they're granted or fully vested. Instead, **taxation happens at the point of exercise**. 
You pay income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on the difference between the strike price and the share price

# example

| shares  | share price | total   |      |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ---- |
| 153,125 | $0.115891   | $17,745 | paid |
| 153,125 | $0.35       | $49,000 |      |
|         | profit      | $31,255 |      |
|         | income tax  | $14,000 | paid |
|         | total paid  | $31,700 | paid |

You're granted 153,125 shares at $0.115891 per share. Total $17,745
The stock increases in value to 0.35/share (total $49k)

you pay the exercise cost, 17k.
this is paid from taxed money, so a hidden tax cost of 45% $7,985

So you made $31,254 profit, even though you can't sell the shares until IPO.

You pay 45% income tax on $31,254.2 = $14k

spent so far $17,7k + 14k tax = $31,7k
you also pay National Insurance on this. 2%

## no IPO
loss $31,700 = £25k
## IPO
let's say no increase in value
spent  $31,7k = £25k
### capital gains
capital gains allowance first £6,000
 $49 = £38.7k 
 £38.7k - £6k = £32.7k
when you sell the stock, 20% capital gain tax on £38.7k=£7,740

spent total £32,740
profit £38,710 - £32,740 = £6k

let's say increase value, then it's all profit with 20% tax
