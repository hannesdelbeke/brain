[[brain]] cells produce waste, which needs removing.
The brain lies in water, but it was unclear how the water is flushed through the brain.
Scientists now  believe slow electric waves during [[sleep]] let neurons synchronize and pump out the waste.

One of the waste products is a plaque that causes [[Alzheimer]]. And people with Alzheimer have a reduced waste removal, which might be the cause.
