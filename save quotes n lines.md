want to save references to quotes, from an epub.
	great UX, remembers date, user, page, line and allows me to write comments.

links
- [readwise](https://readwise.io/) links with your Amazon account and organizes your Kindle highlights

Not great solutions:
- Most only support Kindle :(
- complex opensource kindle->notion [repo](https://github.com/paperboi/kindle2notion)
- https://saveread.io/ manually email clippings.txt 

Physical media doesn't support backlinks
- we can write in our books, this works for personal use only
- we can have a 1 directional link from [[Obsidian]], quoting the book.
  This has been used for years in papers.

https://www.zotero.org/ let's you highlight notes in pdf, and can be linked to [[Obsidian]] with a plugin
mainly a reference manager.
