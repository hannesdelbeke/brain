why people finish books they don't enjoy

- feelings
	- A sense of achievement
		- doing a hard thing gives us a sense of joy when it's over.
	- we don't want to tell ourselves we can't finish it
	- [[sunk cost]], I already read so much, if I stop now it's wasted.
		- It's already wasted. just stop
		- wasted money to not read the book you bought
- It trains your patience & concentration.
	- If we only read what we wanted, we are no different than chasing the latest attention grabbing thing on our phone.
	- [[grit]]
- Reading bad books makes you appreciate and understand good books
- expecting change
	- curious how much worse it can get 
	- what if it get's better
	- I'll be missing something if I don't finish the book
	- wanting to like it, hoping it'll change so you will
- social reasons
	- if I don't understand why this famous book is good, I must be missing something.
	- your opinion on a book carries less weight if you don't finish it
	- You can't claim you read a book if it's not finished.
	- how do I enter it on Goodreads?
	- read a book to explain why it's trash

With anime, tv and games I tend to stop when I'm bored. Why not with books (unless it's really bad)? Why do I finish my average books?

Life is “too short for _bad books_ - Schopenhauer
