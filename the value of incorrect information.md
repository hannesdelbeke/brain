If you explain why something is incorrect, others can learn from it.

Sometimes, it's better to not remove old or outdated info.

e.g. When you find a better way to tackle a problem, it's tempting to remove the old [[documentation]], and replace it with the new process.

Since the new process is written by someone with more experience, it requires more understanding. The new solution might be more complex and abstract, making it harder to comprehend without the context of the first solution.

e.g. A naive way to code a tool with many options, is a hardcoded `if else` for each option. But a more experienced coder might use a dictionary, or a switch.

- **Learning**
  If we leave the old approach documented, but add a link at the top of the documentation to the new approach, [[always explain why you link|describing why it's better]], people can learn why the new approach is better. 
- **Discovery**
  People who don't yet know about the newer, better solution, can't search for the newer solution. Keeping the old solution documented, allows these people to find your documentation for the old solution. Which then links to the new solution, promoting its [[discovery]].
- **Review**
  It can be useful to look back, and compare the new & old approach, e.g. at work. It gives a sense of progress, and can be motivating, or show you if any improvement were or weren't achieved.
