**TouchDesigner** is a node-based [visual programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language "Visual programming language") for [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_rendering "Real-time rendering") interactive [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia "Multimedia") content. e.g. dance lights and lasers.

If you need it. It’s aimed toward realtime, av, and live events, interactive/immersive art etc. If you’re not interested in that, it’s a shitty [[Houdini]].

If you are interested in that it’s absolutely fantastic imo. You have dmx, audio, 3d, and it’s incredibly versatile and user friendly (for what it is, you don’t need extensive programming knowledge to get started)
