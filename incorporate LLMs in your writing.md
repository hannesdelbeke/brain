Auto generated text from [[large language model|LLMs]] usually results in poor [[AI slop]].
It reads poorly, contains untruths, and is just a [[waste of time]].

However, I find it can be valuable when curated by a human, assuming the author knows what they are talking about.
- it doesn't contain untruths anymore
- the author agrees with the message of the text, they signed it off
- it was mostly used as [[productivity|a time saving measure]], or to clean up the writing.

The slop was like the base layer of a painting. And an artist painted on top of it.
Or like how an architect designed the house, but didn't build it themselves.

example note: [[types of research]]

I find it helpful to make it clear to the reader where I used AI. 
Especially when I [[copy paste]] unedited text that's in AI-style format. ([[emojis]], verbose, ...)
I add a heading that says LLM or GPT or AI generated text.
So I can always review the AI text again in the future every time I read my [[Evergreen notes]].
