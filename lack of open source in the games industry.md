I've joined several game dev studios. And re created the same-ish pipelines from scratch at each job.

Why is there no open-source system to solve these problems?
- Because our studio pipeline is unique and special.

Yes, the project has special requirements for the game or product.
A unique name convention, etc.

But we can still reuse core concepts such as "export a mesh to the game engine"
But my mesh needs to be exported in a certain way, to a certain folder based on my unique folder structure.
- This can be defined in a config, or with a hook to a custom script.

the closest system I've seen is [[Pyblish]]
