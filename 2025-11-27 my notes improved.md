My notes seem to have improved a lot compared to a year ago.
- Use full sentences, [[abbreviation|abbreviations]] cause confusion in the future.
- Write about personal experience, and steps to take. Don't search for the truth, write what you think or believe at the time. So you can later reflect and see how your thinking evolved.
	- This especially became strong for code projects, writing why I make a decision. And then later write why it did or didn't work out, linking the original note.

## Notes are meant to be reused
I used mainly note down technical details I wanted to follow up on, like a task list. Or use writing as a way to break down technical concepts. These strange notes made sense to me at the time, but not anymore.

Now, since I write more about feelings and experiences, it feels more useful, more reusable. And a reusable note is the best, since it becomes a part of your [[digital garden]]. Whereas a note that's written once, and never linked to, will never be read again. Just like an [[orphan note]], it can't be discovered.

## Examples
Past notes contain half sentences, often unreadable to me now. e.g.
- [[2022-12-03 tried Obsidian on Android]] - no full sentences & conclusion
- [[2022-12-17 pkm - learn mkdocs]] - a short activity list in, pretty readable, but I likely won't reuse this note, or link it.

Whereas my new style notes read more like a story. e.g. 
- [[2020-08 Gdrive went down]] (written recently) Who cares if it went down in 2020, what matters is the learning. I should backup.
- [[2025-11-25 keepsidian issues]] - full sentences & a conclusion
- this note
