instead of paying 1000.
put 1000 in savings account and get interest
pay monthly free interest off.

also on top of that inflation means you pay less in the future, leading to free discount.

can also do with mortgage.
- release mortgage money against house for 4.5% interest
- put money in savings account with 5%
- pocket 0.5% free money, e.g. on 500k that is 2.5k, not worth it
