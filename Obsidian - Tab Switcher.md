Tried the [[Obsidian plugin]] [Tab Switcher](https://github.com/Vinzent03/tab-switcher), to enable `alt + W` support to go to last tab.
- A tab popup now shows, adding friction in the flow, 
  this can be disabled in settings, Disabling `show modal`.
- The last tab short key didn't work, the reason I got this plugin.
