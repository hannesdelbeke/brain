solidity ratio is a principle that dictates that if blade surface area to the rotated circle remain the same the fan will have equivalent air flow, for the same blade design. 

E.g. a 3 bladed fan with wide blades has the same air flow as a 5 bladed fan who's blades are thinner, assuming both fan blades have the same total surface.
