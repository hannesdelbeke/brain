# Amazon Chime
Amazon Chime is a communications service that transforms online meetings with a secure, easy-to-use
application that you can trust. Amazon Chime works seamlessly across your devices so that you can stay
connected. You can use Amazon Chime for online meetings, video conferencing, calls, chat, and to share
content, both inside and outside your organization.
Amazon Chime works with Alexa for Business, which means you can use Alexa to start your meetings
with your voice. Alexa can start your video meetings in large conference rooms, and automatically dial
into online meetings in smaller huddle rooms and from your desk.
