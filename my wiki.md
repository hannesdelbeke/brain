**Structure**
- notes are atomic (one thought per note)
- notes explain their links to other notes, this creates new knowledge

**Goal**
- Share learnings to help others  
- Automated build & deploy site, publish notes without wasting time
- Tightly link posts, and split knowledge in small atomic chunks where possible.
- Allow unfinished notes to prevent writer's block
- compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
