To get good air quality, you should monitor 
- small particles PM2.5&PM10 (cars, brakes)
- CO2 [[co2 monitoring]]
- HCHO - source pressed wood [[off-gassing]]
- [[Humidity]] - too high encourages mold & dust mites & [[virus|viruses]], aim for 30-50% 
- VOC - inaccurate to measure at home, e.g. deodorant and apple pie smell are both VOC
