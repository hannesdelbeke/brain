Note writing is fun, but not efficient.
- feeling of [[fake productivity]]
- I think many of my notes are never reread. Similar to how [[Google Photos]] removed free photo backup because most selfies never were looked at again.
	- the notes that are reread, 
		- Technical details I struggle to remember, often for work.
		- An abstract context that's difficult to remember, e.g. my fleeting emotional state at a point in time.

feedback loop: 
- Every time you re-read something your brain gets feedback
- [[Evergreen notes]] are reread more than traditional notes. Since they are atomic, they are easier to reuse in other notes.
