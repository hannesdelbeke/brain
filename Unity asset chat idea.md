similar to [[Unity note editor]]
but aimed at a team

Often [[Slack]] conversations about the specifics of assets get lost.
- ~~Link assets in slack by some kind of unique ID, that can then be clicked in Unity to link to the conversation. (seems complex to dev, and bad UX, requiring user to always get the ID and paste it)~~
- Easy: a way to comment on a specific asset in Unity.

> [!example]
> You click an asset, and a conversation shows up:
> - What does this asset do? <small><font color="#595959">Ben 2019-05-01</font></small>
> - I think it's a shader for the water. <small><font color="#595959">Alice 2019-05-02</font></small>
> - Don't forget to update this when editing the water textures. <small><font color="#595959">Mike 2019-05-03</font></small>
> 
> Assets with comments have a [[comment]] icon in the project view.
> New comments show in your [[notification|notifications]].

Comments could be submitted to the project, or be live in a database so commenting is instant. (think Notion)
- in project is easier, works across branches etc.
- database is more complex, but allows for live conversations and notifications.
### naming
If it's not [[instant messaging]], it's more like [[email]].
asset notes, asset discussions, conversations, asset talk, Asset Ask


> [!idea] AI chat
> Ai chats are becoming popular, perhaps this can tie into this?
