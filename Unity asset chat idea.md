similar to [[Unity note editor]]
but aimed at a team

Often Slack conversations about the specifics of assets get lost.
Imagine having a way to comment in Unity about a specific asset, and see it in the editor.

> [!example]
> You click an asset, and a conversation shows up:
> - What does this asset do? <small><font color="#595959">Ben 2019-05-01</font></small>
> - I think it's a shader for the water. <small><font color="#595959">Alice 2019-05-02</font></small>
> - Don't forget to update this when editing the water textures. <small><font color="#595959">Mike 2019-05-03</font></small>
> 
> Assets with comments have a comment icon in the project view.
> New comments show in your [[notification|notifications]].

Comments could be submitted to the project, or be live in a database so commenting is instant. (think Notion)
