https://github.com/tuya/tuya-smart-life official tuya HA extension


> Tuya Integration relies on Tuya IoT Core Service subscription, if the subscription has expired, the integration will stop working. Users are required to manually extend the trial subscription period, which can be inconvenient and frustrating.

> `Tuya Smart Life` (Beta) integration has removed the Tuya cloud development workflow, allowing users to simply scan and log in using the Smart Life app, and then seamlessly sync their IoT devices directly to Home Assistant. It offers a simplified and efficient solution.
