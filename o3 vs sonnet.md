For general developement [[Claude Code]] may be better. But for general debugging , there is nothing that can come close to o3 high which only [[Cursor - The AI Code Editor|Cursor]] has.

I was just trying to fix a rather simple bug , and tried with Claude Code sonnet ultrathink and then with opus .  
Both times, It failed miserably coming up with absolute incorrect conclusions. Claude code infact read parts of file in multiple tool calls, and even got the alignemnet incorrect , and went behind indentation issues.Then I tried the exact same prompt with Cursor Sonnet 4 thinking. It also failed miserably.  
Then I tried o3 high in cursor, and it solved the issue in less than 30 seconds.
