A [[Maya plugin]] [[template]]
repo: https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/maya-plugin-template



## Dev
I could combine the `installer.mel` with the main plugin `my_plugin.py`, so there's only a single file to drag and drop. But keeping them separate means the plugin contains less code, so it's easier to read what the plugin does. And it saves dev time.
