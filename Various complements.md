A [[Obsidian plugin]] to add word & note suggestions in a dropdown, that you can accept with tab or space.

The aim is to speed up typing.

I found I didn't use it that much, except for auto linking the occasional note with `[[Note Title]]`
It also conflicted with [[obsidian-github-copilot]] which is much more powerful.
