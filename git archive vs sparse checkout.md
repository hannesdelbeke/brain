To download a single file, **`git archive`** is generally faster and more efficient than [[git sparse-checkout]]. Here's why:

- **`git archive`**: This command creates an archive of the specified file or directory without downloading the entire repository. It's lightweight and avoids unnecessary data transfer, making it ideal for retrieving a single file.
    
- **Sparse checkout**: While sparse checkout allows you to limit the files in your working directory, it still requires cloning the repository first. This means you'll download the `.git` directory and some metadata, which can be overkill if you only need one file.
    

If you're working with a remote repository and only need a single file, `git archive` is the better choice for speed and simplicity. Let me know if you'd like help with the commands!
