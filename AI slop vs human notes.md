recently (2025-04) I read an article that said

> i m much more interested in the question asked to chat GPT, than the answer. 

the question shows creativity, curiosity from a human. 

the answer on the other hand should always be the same. It's predictable. 
Newer models likely have a more polished answer, better formatted etc, but still the same answer.

In a way it's like the question is a seed for a [[hash function]], where the (answer) output is always the "same"(ish)
