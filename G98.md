If you are connecting single or multiple phase generators at multiple premises of up to 16A (3.68kW) per phase, you need to complete a G98 application form before you can connect.

If you are connecting large scale generation, above 16A (3.68kW) per phase or energy storage, then you will need to complete a G99 form.

Depends if everything including the battery is all done with a single [[hybrid inverter]], G98, as **the system cannot export anymore than the inverter rating**. If you have PV and battery withÂ  seperate inverters G99 as you can exceed the G98 limits.
