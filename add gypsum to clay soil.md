Adding gypsum to clay soil can improve [[drainage]] in the [[garden]]

How it works
1. **Cation Exchange:** Calcium in gypsum (calcium sulfate) replaces sodium (Na+) on the clay particles.
2. **Flocculation:** With sodium gone, the clay particles clump together (flocculate) instead of dispersing.
3. **Aggregation:** These clumps form stable soil aggregates, creating larger pores.
4. **Improved Aeration & Drainage:** The new pore spaces allow air and water to penetrate, improving soil structure and aeration.

notes
- **Sodic Clays:** Works best on clay soils with high sodium content, which makes them sticky and poorly structured.
- **Not for all clays:** Doesn't significantly improve non-sodic clays or clay-loams in the same way; a soil test is recommended.
- **pH Neutral:** Unlike lime, gypsum doesn't change soil pH, making it safe for most plants.


- If your waterlogging is mostly due to **dense, compacted clay**, gypsum helps _some_, but aeration + organic matter often does more.
- **aeration** (for lawns) or **organic matter** (for beds)
