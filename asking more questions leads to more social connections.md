> Dozens of other studies from the University of Utah, the University of Pennsylvania, Emory, and elsewhere have found that ==people who ask lots of questions during conversations==—particularly questions that invite vulnerable responses—are more popular among their peers and more often seen as leaders. They ==have more social influence and are sought out more frequently for friendship and advice==. Any of us can do this in nearly any setting or conversation, be it with a roommate, a coworker, or someone we just met. We simply need to ==ask people how they feel and reciprocate the vulnerability they share with us==.
