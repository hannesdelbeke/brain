	- Emotionally distant caregivers
		- e.g. silent treatment instead of conforting
	- Inconsistent parenting
		- sometimes parents are caring, other times cold
	- Caregiver’s emotional hunger
		- when caregivers seek emotional or physical closeness for their own needs. 
		  e.g. a mom who wants to be involved in all activities of the child.
	  - Anxious caregivers
		  - children with an anxious attachment style are likely to have parents who are also anxiously attached.
