file names
- lower case (except for names & abbreviations)
	- Try to use consistent upper cases for names, e.g. `Obsidian` instead of `obsidian`
	- If in doubt, use the casing from the programming module, e.g. 
	  plugget uses `import plugget`, and `pip install plugget`. We never use Plugget with capitals. So IMO it makes more sense to brand it with lower case.
- spaces between words, instead of dash or underscore (makes things more readable)
- start related notes with the same word if possible, e.g.
	- [[Obsidian plugin - Tabber]]
	- [[Obsidian neurons]]
	- [[Obsidian test images]]
- use the full word as note title, and alias the [[abbreviation]] (except where the abbreviation is so common the full word is never used, e.g. `URL`)
- everything in 1 folder, (read why i decided on  [[reducing note folders]])

note content
- use [[wikilink]]s
- place all images in `image` folder
