You can edit any page on GitHub or your favorite text program, but for the best preview use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

For a quick edit, the easiest is to edit on GitHub.
- On the site, every page has a edit pencil in the top right corner linking to the file.
- just click edit, do your changes and submit for PR

### Setup in Obsidian

Edit these public notes in Obsidian
- fork & clone the repo
- open the local repo as a new vault in obsidian
- edit files â€¦
- commit to git manually, or get the obsidian git plugin
- create a PR from your fork

My private setup:
- setup a private vault
- create a submodule in your private vault
- get the obsidian git plugin, and in options: enable update submodules

### Links
Markdown [[wikilinks]] aren't supported by GitHub preview.
- Please use wikilinks in all files, expect this README.md file, which is the GitHub landing page.

## writing content
lots of devs write bad docs. You won't if you write tight. keep it short!
e.g. Compare the following:
> When I was working on a plugin in maya, I saw that adding ABC to the path did X. 
> In maya, adding ABC to the path does X.
