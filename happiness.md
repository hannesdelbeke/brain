happiness is a sense of purpose and [[well-being]]

According to some [research](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-j-davidson/well-being-skill-learned_b_7102636.html), well-being can be learned by practicing the following:
- Resilience, a function of the brain, resides in the ability to bounce back from adversity.
- Positive outlook lies in a person’s ability to see the positive, both in people and in experiences.
- Attention, or a lack of, can affect a person’s well-being. Being more attentive and using better listening skills can make a person more focused and positive.
- Generosity equals a sense of well-being. Acts of kindness make others and yourself happy.
