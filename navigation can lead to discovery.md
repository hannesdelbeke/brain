Efficient navigating through links, doesn't let the user discover new concepts.
Use navigation in a way where it can lead to [[fun discoveries]].

e.g. a site that sells chairs, links all chair pages to a central chair page.
Users never will discover matching tables, or other furniture they can have in their living room.
With organic [[link|linking]] the user discover things they didn't knew they wanted.
