## ## Exports and Jobs

business-people support free trade,

Business executives believe
- expanded world trade is good for world employment
1. free trade mean more jobs around the world
2. countries compete for those jobs
	- more export = more jobs
	- more import = less jobs
Conclusion: free trade & competitive to attract jobs

economists
- free trade doesn't create more jobs worldwide (and benefits shouldn't be measured in job count)
- high exporters don't have lower unemployment

for every export there's an import. so not more jobs in total

fed thinks: to many jobs = inflation
so controls unemployment through inflation. if export increases, interest will go up. resulting in job less somewhere else (construction)

the result is that import/export is not related to global creating jobs. it'll make new export jobs, but fed will remove the jobs somewhere else.

## ## Investment and the Trade Balance

business-people
increased industry capacity -> company imports less & exports more

economist believes the opposite
[trade balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade) is part of payment balance of a coutnry
diff between total foreign sales & purchases must be 0. 

country is much more complex than a company
companies often focus on 1 area
a good tax system
- neutrality between alternative investments
- low marginal rates
- minimal discrimination between current and future consumption.

## other 
corporation
- consistent accounting, 
- clear lines of responsibility
- ...

businesspeople don't accept the hands-off role of a wise economic policy-maker

being pro active is not good for economic policy

CEOs decide which areas to focus on
but government shouldn't

businesses are open systems,
- e.g. they can increase jobs in their sector (but the sector as a whole stays similar, taking jobs from competitors)
economies are closed
- e.g. not all towns can export their waste to another town)
