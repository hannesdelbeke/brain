now note is a note that explains what you're involved with right now.

The main purpose seems to be for other people to see what you work on, however I think it could be used for yourself as a TODO list. An overview of things that matter to you at this moment.
## Example
- https://mister-chad.com/now 
- a latest page is not a now note but follows the same concept, [example](https://nesslabs.com/articles)
