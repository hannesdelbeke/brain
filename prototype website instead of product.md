use marketing instead of creating a prototype.

game studios create ads for fake games.
the ads that do best, then are used for inspiration on games to create.

devs create a website for a product that doesnt exist.
you can pre purchase it. which adds your email to a list.
once there is enough interest, the dev creates the product and can easily market to their already collected audience.
