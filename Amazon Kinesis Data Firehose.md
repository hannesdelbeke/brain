# Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to reliably load streaming data into data stores
and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon
Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing
business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. It is a fully managed service that
automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It
can also batch, compress, transform, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of
storage used at the destination and increasing security.
You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream from the AWS Management Console, configure it with
a few clicks, and start sending data to the stream from hundreds of thousands of data sources to be
loaded continuously to AWS—all in just a few minutes. You can also configure your delivery stream to
automatically convert the incoming data to columnar formats like Apache Parquet and Apache ORC,
before the data is delivered to Amazon S3, for cost-effective storage and analytics.
