As you say, tied for first place in general-computing pens:
- Wacom EMR on Samsung tablets and Apple Pencil on iPads.
    
Tied for second place:
- MPP as implemented on the **8th and 9th generation Surface devices** that officially support the Slim pens. It works nearly as accurately as [[Apple Pencil]] and Wacom EMR, with wobbly slow lines no worse than older-generation Wacom tech - so pretty great overall, with low latency and high accuracy.
- I don't recommend them, but the latest **Huion devices** like the Slate and the Studio with their 3rd generation pen, they're almost as good as Wacom EMR. They _are_ specifically made for art but they're general-purpose devices too. They are very likely based on expired Wacom patents, and all the important Wacom EMR patents have expired about two decades ago. Can you imagine [[Wacom]] achieved this quality with 1980s tech? EMR pens are amazing. The reason I don't recommend Huion is the quality control
