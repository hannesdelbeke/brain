You can create a [[wiki]] from your notes: [[Obsidian Publish]]
Since note names are used to create web pages, 
when you rename a note, it will break any URL links another website has to your website.  

solution: 
- accept this limitation, this is what i do atm
- never rename notes, only possible if all notes have a unique name, like a hash.
This would look bad in Obsidian without naming every link.

I like to use [[Obsidian]] to write notes
I like to use [[jf8923okj32roijf]] to write notes
I like to use [[jf8923okj32roijf|Obsidian]] to write notes
```
Introduces tech to manage these unique notes, or a strict naming convention .
