Cloud computing is providing developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work like 
- procurement
- maintenance
- capacity planning. 

## Cloud Computing Models
- [[Infrastructure as a Service]]
- [[Platform as a Service]]
- [[Software as a Service]]

### IaaS vs PaaS

A good way to think about IaaS is as the foundation for creating a cloud-based service, such as software or an e-commerce website. 
- IaaS is where the infrastructure is built. 
- PaaS is a platform that allows developers to build apps without having to host them. 

### PaaS vs SaaS

- IaaS is the underlying foundation 
- PaaS is the platform that hosts apps. 
- SaaS is the software that helps businesses or consumers accomplish a wide range of tasks. With SaaS products, the provider manages all aspects of the product, 
	- from the applications 
	- to the data 
	- to the servers 
	so the end-user can focus simply on _using_ the tool. 

- IaaS provides access to resources such as virtual machines and virtual storage
- PaaS provides execution environments, application development, and deployment tools
- SaaS provides software as a service to end-users. Which one you choose depends entirely on the needs of your business.
