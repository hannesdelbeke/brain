## COM scripting
[[Component Object Model|COM]] allows Python to control [[Photoshop]] indirectly.
It's slower than JavaScript, and has a bad reputation for difficult to work with. (From hearsay)

- [COM python tutorial](https://martechwithme.com/photoshop-scripting-with-python-on-windows/) 
- lots of scripting docs for PS classes https://theiviaxx.github.io/photoshop-docs/index.html
- [PS python module](https://github.com/lohriialo/photoshop-scripting-python) (using COM)
