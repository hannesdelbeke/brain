What if [[Bitwarden]] server goes down?

if already logged in:
- you can continue using bitwarden, autfill, etc. from local vault
- you can export passwords for [[backup]]

you can't
- sync between devices
- use web vault

Self hosting gives you the option to not rely on the server, but comes with maintenance and possible extra vulnerability. It doesn't seem worth it.
