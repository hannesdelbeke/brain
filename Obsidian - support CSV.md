It'd be great if [[Obsidian]] could support other file formats.
- Ideally open, view & edit them in Obsidian
- [x] or secondary, clicking them in the file browser opens them with the default app. 
	- [x] Obsidian has support for this: [[Obsidian link non-supported files]]

- [x] I mostly want [[CSV]] support so I can move some of my [[Google Sheets]] over to my [[Obsidian vault]], or my bank statements.
	- I now have a solution for this: [[keep using google drive for my sheets in my vault]]

repo is dead ⚠️
- [x] an [[Obsidian plugin]]: [[CSV]] viewer, see the [github repo](https://github.com/zds-dev/csv-obsidian)
