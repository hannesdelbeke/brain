It'd be great if [[Obsidian]] could support other file formats.
Ideally open them in Obsidian, or secondary, clicking them in the file browser opens them with the default app. 

I mostly want [[CSV]] support so I can move some of my [[Google Sheets]] over to my [[Obsidian vault]], or my bank statements.
