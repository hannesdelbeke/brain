An ERV provides whole-home ventilation. 
- [[heat recovery]], just like an HRV system,
- controls humidity. 
The difference with an HRV: **an ERV also takes the humidity out of the outgoing air and puts it into the incoming air**. ERVs tend to hold on the moisture in the air.

> [!warning]
> ERV is usually not recommended in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] because
> - it maintains humidity, usually MVHR is meant to reduce indoor [[humidity]]
> - it costs more than MVHR

from wiki:
An ERV is a type of air-to-air heat exchanger that transfers [sensible heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_heat "Sensible heat") as well as [latent heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat "Latent heat"). Because both temperature and moisture are transferred, ERVs are described as total [enthalpic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpic "Enthalpic") devices. In contrast, a heat recovery ventilator ([[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]] / HRV) can only transfer sensible heat.

- all ERVs are HRVs, but not all HRVs are ERVs.
- In the UK, [[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]] will be more effective than ERV.
