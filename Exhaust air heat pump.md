An EAHP delivers more heat into your home than a [[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]] system on its own, reducing the running costs of your heating. 

If your new build home needs a MVHR system, combining the function of heating and air handling into one unit rather than having a separate MVHR and heating system will also save upfront and installation costs.
