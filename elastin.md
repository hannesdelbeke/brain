Elastin is **one of the most abundant proteins in your body**. 
It's a stretchy [[protein]] and a major component of tissues in your body that require stretchiness, like your lungs, bladder, large blood vessels and some ligaments.

It resembles a rubber band — it can stretch out (extend) and shrink back (recoil).
