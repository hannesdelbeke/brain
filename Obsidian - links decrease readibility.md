## Problem: text color
I find that [[wikilink|wikilinks]] in text decrease the readability of my notes. Because links are colored dark purple, which clashes with the white color from normal text. A colored word in the middle of a sentence, interrupts the reading flow.
### Solution
in Obsidian settings, you can change accent color which changes note link color.
## Problem: underline
Links are underlined to distinguish them from text. This underline also disrupts reading flow a bit. I think just a color difference would do the trick for me. I already know purple is a local link, and blue is a [[URL]].

- [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/w46tft/remove_underline_change_color_of_internal_links/)
- I noticed the obsidian forum also doesn't use underline's in links.
- I already set [[URL]] color in [[Obsidian distinguish internal & external links]]. I should be able to remove underline there too.
- [ ] links to non existing notes are currently distinguished by not being underlined. It'd be better to change this e.g. to color red. Else when we remove the underline for working links it'll look too similar.
