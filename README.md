# Public notes about game dev & anything else

- knowledge is organized based on zettel / digital garden.  
- For managing this wiki, I use Obsidian
  
The main goal isÂ   
- to publish learnings that would help other devs  
- do this in an easy way. no extra effort on my side. I don't have much time.  
- tightly link posts, and split knowledge in small atomic chunks where possible.
