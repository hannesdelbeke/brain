# Public notes about gamedev & anything else

- knowledge is organised based on zettel / digital garden.  
- For managing this wiki, I use Obsidian
  
The main goal isÂ   
- to publish learnings that would help other devs  
- do this in an easy way. no extra effort on my side. I don't have much time.  
- tightly link posts, and split knowledge in small atomic chunks where possible.

## Contribution

You can edit any page on github or your favorite text program, but for the best preview use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

For a quick edit, the easiest is to edit on GitHub.
- On the site, every page has a edit pencil in the top right corner linking to the file.
- just click edit, do your changes and submit for PR

### Setup in Obsidian

Edit these public notes in Obsidian
- fork & clone the repo
- open the local repo as a new vault in obsidian
- edit files ...
- commit to git manually, or get the obsidian git plugin
- create a PR from your fork

My private setup:
- setup a private vault
- create a submodule in your private vault
- get the obsidian git plugin, and in options: enable update submodules
