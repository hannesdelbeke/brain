Read the notes on the [wiki](https://hannesdelbeke.github.io/wiki/)

- knowledge is organized based on zettel / digital garden.  
- For managing this wiki, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  
**Goal**:
- Share learnings to help others  
- Automated build & deploy site, publish notes without wasting time
- Tightly link posts, and split knowledge in small atomic chunks where possible.
- Allow unfinished notes to prevent writer's block
- compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
