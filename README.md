%%This is the front page of the [wiki](https://hannesdelbeke.github.io/wiki/)%%
This site contains a collection of notes, mostly technical [[knowledge]] related to [[gamedev]] & [[technical artist]] tips. 

I also use it for [[journaling]], getting ideas out of my head, or to research various hobbies & interests (like [[ventilation]]).
Since I write for my future self, in the [[Evergreen notes]] style, there will be:
- unfinished notes
- empty notes with only links
- messy or incorrect data that gets updated on the fly

To [[navigation|navigate]] this [[website]] 
1. Search for something you are interested in, e.g. [[Blender]], [[Unreal]], [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], [[Python]], [[gamejam]], [[tool launcher|tool browser]]
2. [[discovery|Discover]] more by clicking [[URL|links]] in the note you read. Use the [[backlink|backlinks]] at the bottom to find [[public/link|related]] notes.
