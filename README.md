## Public notes about game dev & anything else

- knowledge is organized based on zettel / digital garden.  
- For managing this wiki, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  
The goal:
- Share learnings to help others  
- A automated way, to let me publish notes in an easy way without wasting time
- Tightly link posts, and split knowledge in small atomic chunks where possible.
- Allow unfinished notes to prevent writer's block
