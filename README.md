# Public notes about gamedev & anything else

knowledge is organised based on zettel / digital garden.  
For managing this wiki, I use Obsidian.  
  
The main goal is   
\- to publish learnings that would help other devs  
\- do this in an easy way. no extra effort on my side. I don't have much time.  
\- tightly link posts, and split knowledge in small atomic chunks where possible.
