a [[GitHub]] repo can act as a template.
if you create a new repo from a template, it will be a new repo with a copy of the same file.

## Fork
the difference with a fork is that a fork is supposed to be merged back to the main repo.
and should act as a temporary repo.
a fork will maintain a connection to the original repo making it easier to merge back.

commits in a fork do not count towards your GitHub contribution
