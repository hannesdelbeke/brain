Autophagy is the recycling of damaged cells.

Some autophagy can increase [[longevity]] 
But too much causes [[atrophy]] and decreases lifespan.

Starvation-induced autophagy increases longevity in yeast and mammals.

When you get older, autophagy doesn't work as well.

> Â chronic overnutrition plays a suppressive role of autophagy pathways. It thus remains possible that chronic dietary stress could contribute, in part, to decreased macroautophagy and CMA observed with age

> restoration studies with [[rapamycin]] or with [[upregulation]] of critical regulatory genes have demonstrated that longevity and health-span can potentially be improved by activating these pathways

> Excess autophagy appears to be detrimental to life by inducing atrophy or generalized loss of cells.
