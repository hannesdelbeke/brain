### Edit SVG saving
to edit [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] save data, go to [[Excalidraw]] plugin settings:
- embedding excalidraw n your notes and exporting
	- export settings
		- auto export settings
			- change SVG settings
### Add to library
I use this for UX design of my tools:
Add some presets to your Excalidraw library in Obsidian.
1. click on library on right side
2. click browse
3. search for `universal ui kit` and download it
4. go back to library, and import it

- [ ] [[TODO]] create a `convert to SVG` action for [[MkDocs]] 
### Markdown preview bug
I had to redo this setting whenever I cloned the repo, reopened it in Obsidian
- excalidraw plugin settings
	- appearance and behaviour
		- enable preview in markdown
