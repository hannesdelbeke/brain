when you [[link]] directly to images on a website, instead of copying them on your own website.

### Practical disadvantage
- you have no control over the displayed content on your website.
	- e.g. the original owner can add offensive content to the image.
	- the original image can go offline = [[link rot]]

### Moral disadvantage
- the original owner is paying for the  bandwidth used to display the image on your site. Because of that It's morally frowned on.
	- sometimes hotlinking is called bandwidth theft
		- hotlinking isn't illegal and not actual theft

## Hybrid hotlink
Pinterest & Google use a hybrid hotlink solution: 
- Save thumbnails on own server, minimizing storage & bandwidth costs 
- hotlink to the original size media.
