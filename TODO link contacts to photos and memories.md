it d be great if i could link my contacts to events, posts, ...

[[example of linking to a contact]]

Combine this with [[2026-02-19 Obsidian auto complete app URI|Obsidian auto complete app URI]], so you can start typing `[[Ja` and it auto completes `[[Jack Arthur]]` for your [[Google contacts]]. (using [[wikilink]] or [[hyperlink]])

Or if you have a memory named `2012-01-01 new year party`, you just start typing `[[new year` and it auto completes the memory name.
