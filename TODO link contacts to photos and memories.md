it d be great if i could link my contacts to events, posts, ...

example
i browse through my memories, and see a picture of my friend.
I click on the link to my friend, and he shows up in my contact list.
i can click his [[Instagram]] handle to go to his page, or his [[WhatsApp]] to call him.
i can also see all notes where i mentioned him in [[Obsidian]]

kinda like [[app URI]] + [[Linktree]]

Combine this with [[Obsidian auto complete app URI]], so you can start typing `[[Ja` and it auto completes `[[Jack Arthur]]` for your [[Google contacts]]. (using [[wikilink]] or [[hyperlink]])

Or if you have a memory named `2012-01-01 new year party`, you just start typing `[[new year` and it auto completes the memory name.
