It's nice and quiet when coding or writing, but sometimes it fires up like most laptops and the fans are loud, disturbing the surrounding peace and quiet.

[[Razor synapse]] 4 only offers an auto fan-profile (so no change) or minimum fan of 3500, which is still loud. There's no quiet profile.

The Razor blade is very quiet sometimes on idle, e.g. fans completely shut off.
My [[Dell precision 5680]] is very quiet.
