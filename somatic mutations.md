somatic mutations are genetic alterations that occur in all cells and are mostly inconsequential, but some of them can set a cell on the route to cancer or affect normal function.

lifespan is inversely proportional to the somatic mutation rate
small animals tend to have a higher somatic mutation rate, leading to more cancer etc.
but not always, e.g. naked mole lives 25 years.
