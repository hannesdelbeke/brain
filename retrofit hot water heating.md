For retrofits with [[radiator|radiators]] there are [[air to water heat pump|air to water heatpumps]]  such as Gree Versati and Daikin Altherma which can do both space heating and [[domestic hot water heat pump|DHW heat pump]]. However, sizing such systems (especially when reusing the existing radiators) might be an issue if the buildings are not well [[insulation|insulated]] and require a relatively large heating load which make the system relatively inefficient.
