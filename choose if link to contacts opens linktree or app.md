exploring the idea of [[link|linking]] contacts in my notes
- [[2026-02-21 contacts app]]
- [[2026-02-21 example sync contact scenario]]

### Example
if I had the app described in [[2026-02-19 Obsidian auto complete app URI|Obsidian auto complete app URI]], but it only creates html shortcuts in my vault, like in [[sync URL shortcuts to obsidian vault]]

I could link to `[[Jack]]` and it would auto complete to `[[Jack]]` since it's in my vault. And clicking that link might open [[Google contacts]].
But I wouldn't also be able to link a note to Jack, or easily see [[backlink|backlinks]] for Jack.
I would run into the same issue in [[2026-02-22 strava link with note as middleman|strava link with note as middleman]].

This ties back into [[note linking duplicate source]]

The dream would be, we open it in google contacts, which has backlinks displayed by e.g. an extension.

### Accessing link treee from outside obsidian
If we do have an extension for backlinks in our Browser, we run into an issue.

If we choose the link tree option.
What would this look like, if we link from outside obsidian. 
if we do have the option to use backlinks from our browser.
- [[use more links in life]]
- [[note linking duplicate source]]

e.g. a youtube video links to Jack. we click the jack link in our browser.
- We need our own app to show the link tree hub page.
- Or we open Obsidian, and load the link tree note.
