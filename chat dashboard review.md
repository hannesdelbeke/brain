This [[chat dashboard]] shows how you can move links to web pages or Obsidian.
Create an [[icon]], that when clicked opens the web version of a chat app.
This same approach could be used on a desktop with shortcuts or pin to taskbar.

### Pros
- It's [[portable]]. No need to install any apps or use a custom launcher.
### Cons
- It only works if the app has a web version. E.g. not for reading android messages on a pc.
- It doesn't load messages until clicked. Great for [[social media is distracting|reducing.distraction of social media]], but not ideal if you need to be on top of your messages e.g. for a marketing job.
