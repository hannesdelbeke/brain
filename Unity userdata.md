A great [thread](https://discussions.unity.com/t/can-we-get-individualized-userdata-please/919983/2) describing alternative to userdata using [addRemap](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetImporter.AddRemap.html), since there's only 1 userdata which might clash between different tools.
