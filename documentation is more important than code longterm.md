In the short term, writing the code is the most important. My boss, or I need a task done.
I write the code, it does the thing. Move on to the next urgent task. Don't stop to think or review.

But in the long run? The amount of times I needed to develop an urgent feature, for it to then have no impact or being dropped. It seemed so important, but a few months later it's worthless. It's wasted time. Of course if it did achieve its short term goal, then it's not waste. But often people rush into things, [[feature creep|adding features]] you won't need.

The code that mattered in the long run, is 
- code I published and neatly documented as a standalone project.
- Or code for a specific project, where I wrote clear documentation
- bonus points if I wrote a [[note taking|note]] about it.

I also would like to add to code that mattered, code I learn from.
But without reviewing your code and writing down learnings, these are likely forgotten.
I made the same tools multiple times, but often made similar mistakes because I'd forgotten years later the exact details of the previous implementation.
[[note taking]] and trying to find shared themes, and linking these helps a lot.

I can write the best [[programming|code]], but if nobody knows how to use it, [[dead code|it eventually dies]].
Even if I know how to use it, it likely dies a few months or years later when I moved on.

I can [[learning|learn]] from reading [[documentation]], even if the related code is 10 years old.
I wouldn't try to run it, since it wouldn't be relevant anymore, and it might be in a language i never learned. But I can still learn lessons from it, just from seeing screenshots, and reading the docs.

Looking back on my past [[work|jobs]], there are times when years ago I remember tackling a similar issue. But even if I could access the code, it wouldn't be that helpfull, since I don't have the context around the code anymore. I don't have the input files, or the database access. And I don't have access to the documentation or wiki anymore.
