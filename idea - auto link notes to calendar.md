In my [[monthly review]], I want to see my [[calendar entry|calendar events]]

**current**: I manually browse my [[calendar]] and write events
**idea**: each event auto shows up in my review, sorted by type (sport, social, ...)

options
- use code to access google events - [[edit google calendar with Python]]
- this not maintained obsidian plugin https://github.com/YukiGasai/obsidian-google-calendar

neither of the options seem intuitive and easy
