A fan to extract air from a room. E.g. in the bathroom

Unlike [[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]], there's no heat recovery in a dMEV. But a [[Decentralised Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|dMVHR]] is a dMEV with heat recovery.

It's [[decentralized]], each room with a dMEV has it's own fan & motor.
