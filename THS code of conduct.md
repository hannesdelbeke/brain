Code of Conduct

At [[Trusted House sitters]], we're proud to provide a platform with trust and respect at its core. So that we can keep our community the safe and respectful place it is, all members are asked when joining to agree to our Code of Conduct.

For sitters — when house and pet sitting

I will be respectful to the entire TrustedHousesitters community, regardless of their race, religion, nationality, origin ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.

I will offer my house and pet sitting services free of charge, in exchange for a place to stay.

I will create a comprehensive and accurate sitter profile, including photos and clear information about me.

I will agree all responsibilities with the home and pet owner before a sit is confirmed and will follow the home and pet owner’s instructions in the TrustedHousesitters Welcome Guide.

I will not cancel my sit unless there are extraordinary circumstances. Once on a sit, I will never arrive later or leave earlier than the agreed date and time.

I will make every effort to leave the home as I found it and ensure every care is taken with the owner's pet(s), home and garden.

Should a pet fall ill under my care, I will seek veterinary support and will inform the pet owner as quickly as possible.

If there are any maintenance issues I will contact the owner as quickly as possible for advice.
