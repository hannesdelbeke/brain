### Goal
I want to [[link]] my [[spreadsheets]] in [[my vault]]. e.g. A finance review note in [[my vault]] links to my bank statements sheets in [[Google Drive]].

> [!success]
> I'll [[keep using google drive for my sheets in my vault]], but sync gdrive files to a local folder inside my vault, so I can link them.
### Concerns
- How often do I need to link to sheets? 
- Is it worth doing this work just for [[Obsidian auto complete]]? 
- There's no [[Obsidian backlinks]] support for non-supported files.
	- [ ] [[TODO - show backlinks for non supported files]]
### Log
Things I tried before reaching my solution: [[R&D link spreadsheets in Obsidian]]
