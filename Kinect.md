## compared
similar to [[Intel Realsense]]

The Kinect V2 is optimized to 0.5m ~4.5m while RealSense are designed for 0.2m~1.2m depends on different devices.
The RealSense is more a desktop usage to capture faces and gestures, instead the Kinect V2 could do better to capture the full body actions with all joints.

Intel SDK is nothing like competition. Leap is better at hand tracking, ULSee at facial landmarks, Kinect at body tracking (there is none in Realsense) etc.
