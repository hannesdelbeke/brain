Some of my contacts are only on [[Instagram]].
When I open the app to chat and check my messages, I often get distracted by reels.
[[social media is distracting]]
## Solutions
I installed [[Beeper]] on my pc, which should prevent this, since the app is chat only.
But Beeper keeps disconnecting from Instagram.

I could instead open https://www.instagram.com/direct/inbox/
which avoids all reels.
- Maybe I add a URL shortcut to my [[Windows task bar|taskbar]]
