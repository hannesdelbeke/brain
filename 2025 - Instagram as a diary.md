I use [[Instagram]] for [[memory post]]. Each picture is a memory, then I can scroll through my wall to remember when I was doing what. 
e.g. How long has it been since I went back to Belgium and ran into this friend.
Where did I meet this person, etc.

When I meet someone, and they ask me about my holiday, I often scroll back on Instagram since I forgot where I've been. 
- Just like how I would forget where to go if I didn't use [[google calendar]]. 
- Or people's birthday and phone nr in [[Google contacts]]. 
It's a [[second brain]]
The reason I want a more universal app, is because I use these apps all the time, and the [[attention switching|context switching]] is [[interrupt|interrupting]]. 
- I know I have a note but I can't see it right now because I'm on mobile.
- I know it's 3 years ago, but have to scroll down and wait for images to load

The nice side is that most of my friends are on instagram, and can see my nice memories. The drawback is that it might become me trying to post to impress instead of for myself.
