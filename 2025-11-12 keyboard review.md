Lately I've been typing mostly on my [[razor blade 15 rz09-02705w76 2018|laptop]]'s keyboard.
I've not used [[KB Paradise KBPV6000|my mechanical keyboard]] for months.
- It's annoying to plug in again after traveling with my laptop.
- I unplug it due to limited USB ports, and don't end up plugging it back in
- I need to move it when I'm cleaning.
- The cable gets in the way + [[visual clutter]]
- I think the low profile of my laptop's keyboard is easier on the wrists.
- Flat keys are easier to press, requiring less effort.

Do I need a keyboard atm? I'm not sure.
It would be less bulky than a laptop on my desk.
- My laptop is doing the job atm, if it works, it works.
- A laptop has easy accessible USB ports I use occasionally
	- a USB hub linked to [[docking station]] would take care of this. Docking stations also have USB ports built-in, but then you see all cables, increasing [[visual clutter]]

In the past I spent time researching the perfect budget [[mechanical keyboard]]. Now I have 2 that I never use. [[gearhead]]
