# TODO
#TODO make this tool
## goal
The [[Unity]] main menu, & right-click menu are overwhelming.
A [[tool launcher|command browser]] would hide this clutter.
## tech
plugin infrastructure

mode 1: pure commands
- recreate all default unity menu commands. e.g. open project settings
- custom commands. e.g. launch my editor tool (this can also be a menu command)

mode 2: right click commands in asset browser
right click shows a lot of commands in the project browser, to the point where it's overwhelming and fills the whole screen.
instead show an option that says "browse commands"
this opens a command browser with commands that run on that directory
### features
- [[search bar]]
- [[favorite]]
- [[categorize]]
- option to add custom commands
