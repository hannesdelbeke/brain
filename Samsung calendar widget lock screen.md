When a calendar event happens, [[Samsung Galaxy Tab A8]] (Android 14) flashes the whole screen blue with a ping. It's a great reminder for when you are distracted and coding.

> likely due to Samsung's **One UI** customizations. Samsung adds additional features and tweaks to Android, and one of those could be a visual notification effect for calendar events, like the blue flash.

My [[Pixel 5]] doesn't seem to have this. (Android 14)
