## Save time
I spend [[time]] writing notes, storing data I think will be useful in the future. Save time in the future.

But all time spent now is gone, and not all time in future is saved. So there's a high chance I lose time writing notes.

I wonder how much of this is similar to [[the drawbacks of categorizing]]

I also write notes to think deeper. Define a problem or idea into a more abstract concept or feeling, so it's easier to keep in my head, because [[limited brain working memory|my brain has limited working memory]].
