# advice 
Do not spend a lot of time wishing your partner was different on things like personality or [education](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/education "Psychology Today looks at education") or political views. Focus, instead, on what you can do to make the dynamic between the two of you as good as it can be. That is going to mean [looking for levers you can pull](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/sliding-vs-deciding/201912/satisfaction-is-important-give-me-lever-pull) to make a difference (such as listening more to your partner, planning to do something you both enjoy, and being more emotionally supportive)—not waiting around for your partner to change.
