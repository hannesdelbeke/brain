- thinning of my bucal fat pads. I was 27 and had really chubby cheeks. I never imagined that at 50 I’d really want all that fat back. [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/17q4xne/comment/k8amwxq)

- botox
	- Botox lip flip. The first time I did it the plastic surgeon messed up or used too much and I ended up with this weird flat lip for almost 6 months. The second time didn’t make my lip flat but I couldn’t smile or use a straw.
	- Any botox around the mouth. I had botox injected to help prevent frown lines. I could not rub my lips together for months and my mouth muscles were sore for a llloonnngff time bc new muscles had to be engaged to take over for the frozen ones
	- Botox - at first I did not regret it at all and I loved it, but then I loved it so much I kept going back for more…and I just got carried away with the whole thing. My face definitely started to look weird af
	- Got botox for crows feet and regret it. Now when I smile, I don't look happy. I just look scary instead because my mouth is smiling but my eyes look stoic
- micro blading doesn't age well
