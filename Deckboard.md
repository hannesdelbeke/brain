Deckboard is not open source, but there is a free version with limited grid.
## Review
pros
- tested it out it's very straightforward to use, works well. super easy to install
- runs over WiFi, LAN or USB
- very smooth and feels instantaneous. 
- supports screensaver to avoid [[OLED]] burn-in
- supports don't go to sleep for mobile device
- cheap: 4Â£

cons
- needs to reconnect when pc shuts down
- free version has limited grid
- a button that simulates a key press, doesn't work with [[Barrier]]
- I noticed very small lag when typing very fast on multiple virtual buttons, which queued up the keys, so it's not 100% as fast as [[stream deck]] i assume. this was over [[WiFi 6]], wonder if USB is faster.

I researched a bunch of these virtual stream decks, because I love the technology. Not because I have a strong use case for it. I should instead  [[fall in love with the problem, not the solution]]
