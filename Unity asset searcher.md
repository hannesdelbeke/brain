[[Unity]] ships with a default search tool.Â  
in the project Tab, next to the search bar there's an expand icon.
You can search assets, gameobjects in your open scene,  menu commands, and settings.

features
- Save searches
- a [[tool launcher]] for tools added to the menu
	- You can't create tool/command categories. The closest alternative is sub menus and saving your search.
	- no thumbnails for menu commands
	- You can favorite results/tools, but no easy way to see favorites unless you do a search containing that favorite
- it seems you can [[favorite|star]] results. But it's unclear how to see your starred items.
