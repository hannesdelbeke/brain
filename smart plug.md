remotely toggle an [[electric socket]]

a lot of smart plugs measure power consumption, giving you more automation options. e.g.:
- Run a vacuum robot IF your phone in the bedroom is charging.
- Turn down the radio IF the webcam is on.
- Turn on subwoofer when stereo is on, but not at night

most smart plugs are relays
all relays are noisy and make a click when toggling on/off.
to avoid this you can use a [[light dimmer]], or solid state relay
