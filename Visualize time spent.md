the book [[Hyperfocus - book|Hyperfocus]] also mentions:
set a few reminders through the day. when the reminder goes off, look back and see if you got distracted.
when you are carried away, you don't notice it. The act of looking back makes you self aware that you were carried away. And enables you to act on it.

[[Slack]] now has a similar great feature. When ending a huddle (voice chat), it posts in the channel how long you chatted for. This UX makes you self aware of how long you spent in a meeting or [[1 on 1|1on1]].

Reflecting by looking back on a [[google calendar]], is a good way to see where your time went.
