[[reminders to refocus during day]]


[[Slack]] now has a similar great feature. When ending a huddle (voice chat), it posts in the channel how long you chatted for. This UX makes you self aware of how long you spent in a meeting or [[1 on 1|1on1]].

Reflecting by looking back on a [[google calendar]], is a good way to see where your time went.
