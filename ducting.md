Ducting is usually hidden, but can be visible too.

circular ducting
- takes up more height
- tighter seal
- less friction
- cheaper & faster to install
- not efficient for low pressure

rectangular ducting
- less high
- more asthetic
- worse seal
- Easily connects fan coil to main duct (what's this??)
- louder
- more expensive

ducting is used in a [[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]] system.
[[Decentralised Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|dMVHR]] avoid ducting, but might be more expensive and louder.

## Cleaning
Air duct cleaning entails large negative pressure vacuums and roto brush equipment which is costly and too bulky for individual use. Hire a certified air duct cleaning company for this.
