An orphan note is a note that has no links to another note, and therefore is undiscoverable. 

> [!warning]
> I also refer to orphaned notes as `unlinked notes`, because they're notes with no links. However,  don't confuse this with when I use the term [[unlinked notes]] to describe notes that have links to other notes, but not to each other. 

Notes with links cans still be undiscoverable:
If a few notes link to each other, but non of those notes link to the rest of the notes, it's never possible to reach these few notes. 
It's like having 2 separated [[network|networks]], that are not connected with each other.
