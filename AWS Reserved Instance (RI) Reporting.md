# Reserved Instance (RI) Reporting
[[AWS]] provides a number of RI-specific cost management solutions out-of-the-box to help you better understand and manage your RIs. 
Using the RI Utilization and Coverage reports available in [[AWS Cost Explorer]], you can visualize your RI data at an aggregate level or inspect a particular RI subscription. To access the most detailed RI information available, you can leverage the AWS Cost & Usage Report. You can also set a custom RI utilization target via [[AWS Budgets]] and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define.
