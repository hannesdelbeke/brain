[[casting|Casts]] over the internet

wonder if it would still work if google drops support? 
e.g. after google dropped Stadia, the Stadia controller has no more Bluetooth support

- Due to patent issues with sonos, Google broke some 3rd party devices with chromecast built in (reported [here](https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Streaming/Chromecast-Audio-no-longer-working-in-Google-Home/m-p/91333/highlight/true#M9386))
  To avoid any future issues. Only use devices by Google.
