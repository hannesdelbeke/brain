Get [[dark mode]] on your title bars, e.g. in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]]

Tested on [[windows 11]] 
1. right click the app icon 
2. open properties 
3. in the target, add ` -platform windows:darkmode=1`
4. also set windows to dark palette
	1. Personalisation > Colors 
	2. choose your mode : select `Dark` from the drop-down 
5. launch the app, you now have dark title bars

useful for Qt5 since Fusion style doesn't color the title bar to black, unlike in Qt6
