intro

what is openmaya
a wrapper around c++ API

why use it
faster operations

why not use it
complex, time consuming

how to use it
in combination with pymel, preferably using custom api (make basic api during tutorial + available on pip)
how to read the docs
video on how to convert docs to python
how to use in combination with pymel

get mesh
iter over verts
tangent/normal/....

get materials
explain layers/groups

iter nurb curve verts/points

optimisation tips: re use classes instead of reinstantiate

---------

create standalone tools (quick rig, exporter, ....)
create pipelines instead of tools (combine tools in package/workflow, automate testing, control the workflow by having insight and prevent repeat mistakes)
knowledge on 3d assets / game engine (normals, tangent, shaders, lods, ...)
