I often try [[discovery|discover]] better solutions. e.g. designing a [[validation]] workflow at [[work]].

1. [[Research]] existing approaches
2. Weigh pros and cons
3. Draft and refine my own approach
4. Test it in practice - [[development]]
5. Update notes with feedback

I call this [[research and development|R&D]] if it involves [[development]].
If I’m only running thought experiments, I think of it as just [[research]].
But what if I reach conclusions not found online, but not do any development?

## GPT answer

🔍 [[Research]]
- **Definition:** Systematic investigation to establish facts, gather knowledge, or explore ideas.
- **Your “mind exercises”:**
- When you [[brainstorm]], analyze, and try to solve problems theoretically (without building or coding), you’re doing **research**.
- Even if your conclusions aren’t found online, they’re still part of research — because you’re generating new insights or hypotheses.
- **Outcome:** Knowledge, frameworks, or conceptual solutions.

🛠️ [[development]]
- **Definition:** Applying research to create, test, and refine something tangible (a workflow, a tool, a prototype).
- **Your “validation workflow” example:**
- Once you start coding, testing, and iterating, you’ve moved into **development**.
- **Outcome:** A working system, process, or product.

⚖️ Where Your “Mind Exercises” Fit
- If you’re **only theorizing** → it’s **research**.
- If you’re **building or testing** → it’s **development**.
- If you’re **doing both** (idea + prototype) → it’s [[research and development|R&D]].
