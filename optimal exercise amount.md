## super TLDR
Optimal weekly exercise is 6 hours [[moderate aerobic activity|moderate]] AND 2.5 hours [[vigorous aerobic activity|vigorous]]
## Notes
This is in contrast with "move naturally" in [[blue zones]]
This is approximately 22.5 to 40 [[metabolic equivalent of task|MET]]-h/week.

> [!NOTE]- TLDR
> The nearly maximum association with lower mortality was achieved by performing

> - 300 to 600 min/week of long-term leisure-time [[moderate aerobic activity]]
> - or an equivalent combination of both. e.g. 300 min moderate AND 150 min vigorous
> 	- moderate: 6 days x 1h

> working out 2-4 times the minimum vigorous physical activity recommendations led to a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Those who worked out 2-4 times above the moderate physical activity recommendations—about 300 - 600 minutes each week—saw the most benefit.
> 
> Participants who performed two to four times above the recommended amount of moderate physical activity had a 26% to 31% lower all-cause mortality and a 28% to 38% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. On top of that, there was an observed 25% to 27% lower risk of non-cardiovascular disease mortality.
> 
> Additionally, adults who worked out two to four times more than the recommended amount of vigorous physical activity —about 150 to 300 minutes per week—were found to have 21% to 23% lower risk of all-cause mortality, according to the study. They were also reported to have 27% to 33% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and 19% lower risk of non-cardiovascular disease mortality.
