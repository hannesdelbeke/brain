## cable size
DC cables may be thicker than AC cables because DC is transmitted at a low voltage, and the current becomes higher, requiring a thicker cable to sustain the load.

Longer cables require thicker wires to support fast charging speeds. 
Thicker wires have 
- a higher current capacity. 
- lower electrical resistance because there is more space for electrons to flow through, allowing more current to flow.
- can carry more power safely, which is important for electrical applications over longer distances. 
- longer cords can increase resistance and potential power loss, which can lead to voltage drops and cause equipment to malfunction.
