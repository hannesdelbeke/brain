Carnitine is a substance that helps the body turn fat into energy. 

Your body makes it in the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]] and stores it in the [[skeletal muscles]], [[heart]], [[brain]], and [[sperm]]. Usually, your body can make all the carnitine it needs, even vegetarians.

Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in [[metabolism]]

Though more research is needed, **L-carnitine may help increase [[weight loss]] and fat burning**. Studies also support its use for health, [[brain]] function, and disease prevention. Supplements may also benefit those with lower levels, such as older adults, vegans, and vegetarians.


> [!NOTE]- L vs D carnitine
> Carnitine exists as one of two [stereoisomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoisomer "Stereoisomer"): the two [enantiomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer "Enantiomer") d-carnitine (_S_-(+)-) and l-carnitine (_R_-(−)-). Both are biologically active, but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form
