Carnitine is **a substance that helps the body turn fat into energy**. 

Your body makes it in the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]] and stores it in the [[skeletal muscles]], [[heart]], [[brain]], and [[sperm]]. Usually, your body can make all the carnitine it needs.

Carnitine supplementation increased skeletal [[muscle]] carnitine stores  by approximately 13% in [[vegetarian|vegatarians]], but not in omnivores, ([study](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/))

Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in [[metabolism]]

Though more research is needed, **L-carnitine may help increase [[weight loss]] and fat burning**. Studies also support its use for health, [[brain]] function, and disease prevention. Supplements may also benefit those with lower levels, such as older adults, vegans, and vegetarians.
