first commercial solo game made.
- released on google play
- released on steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/681620/Cube_Link/
- [[Unity project]]

A puzzle game I developed on my own. I did all code, art, leveldesign and soundeffects. The goal is to connect all tiles of the same color, without disconnecting previously connected tiles. The gameplay is based on the original flowbased color connect genre but adds the challenge of 3 dimensions.
