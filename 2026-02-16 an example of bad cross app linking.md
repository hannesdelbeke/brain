I could not easily find notes related to a forum post in Obsidian, despite knowing that the forum post URL is in the note I'm searching for.

- Backlinks in the browser would have solved this. [[use more links in life]]
- Figure out how to search URL's in Obsidian, or use another app to search

### Goal
I'm trying to find notes related to my forum post
https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-unity-bi-directional-links/98835

### Problems
There's no easy way to do so, because [[URL]] has no [[Obsidian backlinks]] support. (This note [[note linking duplicate source]] tries to solve this)

I have a related youtube video, which I found, but it has no links to the notes I'm looking for either.

I couldn't search the forum URL in Obsidian with `ctrl`+`F`, it showed no results.
### Bad solution
I eventually found it ([[Unity note editor]]) by searching part of the URL: `unity-bi`

# TODO
### Ideal solution
I want the option to see links in my [[Chromium]] browser.
Then I could, when I found the Youtube video, link back to the related notes.

Since my obsidian files are digital notes, [[digital asset management]] might be a relevant topic. It usually deals with game dev files, e.g. 3d models.

- [ ] Maybe I can sync a list of my youtube video names or metadata to my vault.
