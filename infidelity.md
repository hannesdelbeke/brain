- **Decline Before Infidelity:** Both victims and perpetrators experienced a gradual decline in well-being before the infidelity. For perpetrators, this might lead to starting an affair. For victims, feeling their partner's dissatisfaction might make them more likely to be cheated on.
    
- **No Steady Recovery:** Unlike other negative events, people didn't steadily recover after infidelity. Small improvements were seen, but overall, neither victims nor perpetrators returned to their initial well-being levels.
    
- **Commitment Affects Recovery:** People highly committed to their relationship suffered more after infidelity, while less committed individuals sometimes felt better. Unfaithful women often recovered well, possibly because their affairs addressed relationship dissatisfaction.
    
- **Impact of Secrecy:** Negative effects were stronger for perpetrators who kept their infidelity secret compared to those whose infidelity was known. Disclosure of infidelity might help couples address relationship problems.
