## Problem
i often find myself in need of opening certain folders in apps. e.g. 
- appdata/addons in blender
- unreal plugins folder
- unreal site packages folder
- open a certain tool

Create an easy workflow to open these shortcuts
could be done with an [[tool launcher]] like [[buttonizer]].

the main thing to figure out is the [[UX]]
- easy to install the tool, since [[most tools are not easy to install]]
- easy to take workflows with me (between computers, reinstalls, ...)
- easy to add workflows. buttonizer atm doesn't has this.
