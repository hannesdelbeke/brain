create a dev environment for e.g. unreal, blender, maya
and a release env.
### Dev env
in the dev env, we hookup to code in the source repos
[[Python packages editable install]]
[[Unreal plugin to symlink plugins]]
[[mklink windows - soft & hard link]]
### Release env
in the release env we install from pip and plugget pkgs
and update only through online sources.
[[Python pip]]
[[plugget]]
### launcher
we might be able to use a [[app launcher]] to handle the [[environment management]]
e.g. [[my app launcher]]
