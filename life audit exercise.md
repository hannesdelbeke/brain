A friend did a life audit:

Do step 1 without looking at the next steps!

1. write down 100 things you want to achieve next year. e.g.: 
	- Go to Brighton (a new city)
	- learn how to knit
	- get a promotion
	- make a new friend

> [!NOTE]- next steps
> 2. sort them by category. e.g.:
> 	- work
> 	- travel
> 	- social
> 3. each category gets 1 point per entry.
> 4. now you can count what categories are the most important in your life
> 
> drawbacks:
> - this technique looks at quantity, so tickets are not weighted.
