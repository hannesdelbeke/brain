most air to air heatpumps are reversible [[air conditioning]] systems

the manufacturer makes both the heat source, the controls and the heat sink (the emitter of heat).

But with an air-to-water heat pump system a manufacturer is only involved with manufacturing the heat source and not the heat sink e.g. they don’t make the radiators.

## Tips
[source](https://forum.buildhub.org.uk/topic/32724-sizing-a2a-heating/?do=findComment&comment=481850)
- You don't need an internal unit in every room or where you currently have a radiator - A2A blows warm air through the house, especially useful if you have corridor or open plan layouts.  
- The floor based units seem noisier / blowier (but still quiet TBH) than the wall ones - maybe because the wall ones are further away though?  
- You can have more -or- less kW capacity on external vs internal multisplit - but there are limits / rules etc.  
- You can't really put an A2A inside unit in a bathroom - so need IR panels or electric immersion radiators etc with their own control system.   
- **Control is by default - not good - expect to pay extra or add on**  Control on A2A is generally bad - its, by default, based on IR remotes for each inside unit - a far cry from a zoned timer system and you risk a proliferation of clocks through the house or dependency on apps and all the layers of software and network that need to work to keep them happy.  
- 100% Research the wired options for control - especially if you can pickup and self install those parts after the difficult A2A install itself.  
- **Location**  
  The installers like to put the units on outside walls (generalism) - but can be persuaded otherwise just needs a little planning and legwork to keep their lives inside their comfort zone while also getting what you need. 
- **Google searches that I found useful:**
	- BTU to kW  
	- `<model> install pdf ` 
	- `<model> user pdf` 
	- `<make or make multisplit> combination pdf`  
- Sometimes it picks up australian documentation or European - if so can be a guide if not completely accurate -  depends who left documents publically available
