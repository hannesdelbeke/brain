# Amazon Route 53
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It
is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating human readable names, such as www.example.com, into the
numeric IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53
is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.
Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS—such as EC2
instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or [[Amazon S3]] buckets—and can also be used to route
users to infrastructure outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks
to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and
its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 traffic flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through
a variety of routing types, including latency-based routing, Geo DNS, and weighted round robin—all
of which can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant
architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 traffic flow’s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how your
end users are routed to your application’s endpoints—whether in a single AWS Region or distributed
around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registration—you can purchase and
manage domain names such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS
settings for your domains.
