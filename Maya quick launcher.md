Quick launcher exposes all `maya.cmds` ([docs](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2023/ENU/?guid=GUID-55B63946-CDC9-42E5-9B6E-45EE45CFC7FC)) commands in a simple UI.
Since some maya commands require input arguments, not all commands will work. e.g. [unloadPlugin](https://download.autodesk.com/us/maya/2009help/commandspython/unloadPlugin.html)

- see `flowlauncher` for windows
### improvements
- even quicker is voice control (e.g. with chat GPT / amazon alexa) [[speech to text - Python]]
- show completer when pressing backspace
- make modular, so it can be reused outside Maya
