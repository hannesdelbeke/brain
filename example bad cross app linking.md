I'm trying to find notes related to my forum post
https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-unity-bi-directional-links/98835
There's no easy way to do so.

I also have a related youtube video, which I found, but it has no links to my notes either.

- I couldn't search the forum URL in Obsidian, it showed no results
- I found it ([[Unity note editor]]) by searching part of the URL `unity-bi`

I want the option to see links in my [[Chromium]] browser.

Since my obsidian files are digital notes, [[digital asset management]] might be a relevant topic. It usually deals with game dev files, e.g. 3d models.
