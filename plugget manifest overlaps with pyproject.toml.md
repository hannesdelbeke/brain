a [[plugget manifest]] has a lot of overlap with a [[pyproject.toml]]
- pip dependencies
- package name
- docstring / description
- doc url
- repo url
- commands / actions

the main difference is that it's [[pure python]], vs generic (plugget)
so we can support mel & max script, or java script in adobe software.
