By default, the [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] script editor doesn't print in colors.
To quickly spot errors, the console should show:
- red for errors, yellow for warnings.
- Bonus: color variable names & functions.

You can avoid scripting in the [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] editor with an external IDE, but the console output is still often read in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].
