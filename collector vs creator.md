What do you call someone who's more interested in things than using them?
- A musician collecting lots of music gear but doesn't make much music.
- A developer who buys the latest GPU & tech, but doesn't develop much.

### Terms
- **[[gearhead]] / Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS)**  
    Common in music and tech circles, this refers to someone obsessed with acquiring gear more than using it. It’s playful but often self-critical.
- **Collector vs Creator**  
	A collector accumulates tools, assets, or instruments, often for the joy of owning or curating. A creator actively uses them. Some people lean heavily toward the collector mindset.
- **Hobbyist**  
	Sometimes used for someone who dabbles or enjoys the idea of a craft more than deep engagement. Not inherently negative.
- **Tool Fetishist / Tech Fetishist**  
	A more pointed term for someone who romanticizes tools or technology, sometimes at the expense of actual output.
- **Aspiring X**  
	E.g., aspiring musician or gamedev — implies interest and intent, but not yet consistent practice.
- **Creative Procrastinator**  
	Someone who prepares extensively but delays execution. Often driven by perfectionism or fear of failure.
- **Possibilitarian** (rare, poetic)  
	Someone who loves the _possibility_ of creation more than the act itself.
    
### Underlying Dynamics
This pattern often reflects:
- **[[perfection|perfectionism]]** — waiting for the “right setup” before starting
- **Fear of judgment** — easier to collect than to expose your work
- **Joy in potential** — the thrill of what _could_ be
- **Identity signaling** — owning gear as part of self-image
