### Review
> [!SUCCESS]
> - amazing app
> - great chrome plugin

> [!WARNING] Improve
> - no easy backup of notes
> - [obsidian hypothesis plugin](https://github.com/weichenw/obsidian-hypothesis-plugin) needs more work
> 	- sync only 1 directional (primitive get notes)
> 	- no support for replies, [bugreport](https://github.com/weichenw/obsidian-hypothesis-plugin/issues/62)
> 	- overall this plugin is a bit buggy
> 	- syncs several notes in 1 page

### Needed
- bidirectional sync would allow me to add [[wikilink]] to the notes, linking [[Obsidian ]] notes to my web notes
- better [[backup]] support, or a better sync plugin would give me more control over my notes

### Other
Comparing output note style from testing the plugin :
- [[original - Blender 3.4 Python API Docs]]
- [[edited - Blender 3.4 Python API Docs]]

there is a Hypothesis API: [docs](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
