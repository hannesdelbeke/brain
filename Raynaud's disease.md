## Primary
Primary Raynaud's is more common in people who live in cold climates and those who have a family history of Raynaud's.
## secondary
Risk factors for secondary Raynaud's include:
- Cigarette smoking.
- Age in women. Raynaud's tends to occur between the ages of 20 to 40, although secondary Raynaud's tends to happen later.
- Using vibrating tools such as chain saws and jackhammers.
- Taking some medications, including some cancer drugs, narcotics, and over-the-counter cold medications.
- Having had frostbite.
- Repetitive motion -- for example, typing or playing the piano.
- Carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Other medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), and carpal tunnel syndrome. If you have Raynaud's because of these conditions, it is called secondary Raynaud's and is often more severe.
