I first noticed slippery soles when I bought the super cheap KALENJI running shoes from Decathlon. Any wet tiles in a city or wet rocks on a trail, would send me slipping like i was walking on ice. I'm unsure if this was so from the start, or started after having worn rather quickly through the cheap soles. having flattened the threads.

The cheap but nice shoes I bought on my [[Lisbon]] trip have the same issue, from when I bought them. Both have a cheap sole made out of a single white material / foam.

So how can I buy shoes that don't have this issue?
First of all, you can't test the grip on a wet marmer stone in the shop.

Most decent shoes I owned didn't had this issue. 
- Often the sole is not a single chunk but is made out of multiple types of sole material
- The sole has a more sticky rubbery feel. Instead of a harder slippery foamy feel.
- Sufficient threading in the sole, ensuring the shoe is not too flat, but that's no guarantee. 
	- [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskACobbler/comments/17ed0zk/new_hiking_boots_too_slippery_would_siping_help/) about slippy Scarpa Terra GTX with well threaded vibram soles

- The Columbia Redbud Transalp reviews mention the lack of friction when wet, 
	- but it looks on first sight to be made out of 2 different sole materials. On closer look it looks the same but painted.
	- these are very well threaded, yet are still slippy.

> [!NOTE] conclusion
> Seems a good tactic is searching for the model online, and go with a popular one that has blog reviews by trail runners. And avoid cheap shoes.
