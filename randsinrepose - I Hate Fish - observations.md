[[AI summary - I Hate Fish]]

Just like how you can waste time on the [[meta]] of task management, [[time]] can be wasted on meta of other things:
- [[minimal notetaking]]
- [[people manager]]

I resonate a lot with this article:

He's a super taster, I'm a super smeller.

I use the same email setup. Unsubscribe from everything to create high signal in my inbox, (but not [[inbox zero]])

Rand's suggestion to *delete tasks older than 30 days*, reminds me of [[cache]] / [[optimized cache sorting]] mentioned in the book [[Algorithms to Live By]]. Only recent things matter, old things are dated.

  Could be extrapolated to, for every task you take on, delete an old task.
  
I have similar struggles with productivity systems. Sometimes I blame myself, other times I think that perhaps it's the system itself - or the way I'm using it - that's not intuitive.
- I used to have a [[Todoist]] list for work and for home. After a while this list grew to hundreds of tasks and I kept postponing. Rands ran into the same issue with his paper list.
- I tried to rewrite my todo-list daily in [[obsidian]], but "postponing" tasks just kept pilling up, and eventually I stopped reporting them.
