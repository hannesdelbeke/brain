It feels like a more efficient use of my time, when I listen to an [[audiobook]] while doing something physical like dishes, [[running]], [[cleaning]], [[commuting]], ... 

But it also feels like a [[waste of time]] when I do those things without the audiobook.
This feels like a negative way of thinking.

Audiobooks also can be addictive, so I start doing things I wouldn't otherwise do, e.g. long walks, excessive time gardening, ... just to listen to an audiobook. - [[procrastination]]
