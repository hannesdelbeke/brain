- In the case of [[lithium iron phosphate battery|LiFePO4]], you can mix different brands and capacities as long as each battery has their own [[battery management system|BMS]] and all batteries are connected to a common bus bar.
- check the number of cells per battery. Not a good idea to mix 15 and 16 cell batteries.
