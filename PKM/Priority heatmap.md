### problem
A task is mentioned, and you write it down.
The next day or week, it is mentioned again. You realize it's important, but you are also busy with several other tasks and forget about it the next day.

You might write it down today's daily note TODO.
You might add it to a planning board.
But somehow this task can still slip your mind, when working on several other important tasks.

### proposal
A planning system showing how often a task is mentioned, could help with prioritizing.
