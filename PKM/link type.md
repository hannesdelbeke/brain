being able to add notes or relation ship to links

right now we can link note A to note B, but it's not always clear why they are related.
Ideally the note says: Note A relates to note B because of reason.
e.g. `[[Bob]] is [[Lucy]]'s dad'`

there's a great forum discussion on this [add support for link types](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-link-types/6994/38)
