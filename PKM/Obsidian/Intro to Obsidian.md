I want to start using [[Obsidian]] to manage my notes, but am overwhelmed. Where do I start?

1. Start writing notes in markdown files without organizing them.
   don't worry about the structure or if you do it right.
2. Learn [[wikilinks]]
   simple type 2 `[[` and the name of a note to link that note
   this is the key to good note taking in Obsidian.
3. Use hashtags to start creating trends across your notes. It will help you noticing patterns between your notes.
4. Once you get used to things, install some plugins, tweak the settings, etc.
   most plugins are optional, these are my only vital plugins:
	- [[Obsidian Git]] to backup your notes on git
	- `paste URL into selection`, to select a word and paste a URL
	- `paste image png to jpg`, to easy paste images from the internet in jpg
