# Backups
To avoid losing notes when the hard drive crashes or gets stolen, we need backups

## Git
Git is a backup system popular with programmers. It's a bit more technical.
There's a git extension for [[Obsidian]], see [[Obsidian Git]]
- on Windows PC, the git plugin works well and supports submodules.
- on Android, it doesn't work as smoothly, with occasional merge issues. And it doesn't support submodules on Android.

## Dropbox & OneDrive
not yet tested with Obsidian, should be pretty smooth and support mobile.

Currently I've only got 1 backup in the cloud, and 1 on device. 
Wonder if it's worth doing a second backup in the cloud, in case GitHub has issues.
