### Idea
It'd be great if you can leave private comments in a note & store the comment in another file.
Currently when sharing [[Obsidian]] notes, all note content (including comments) is shared. Sometimes you want to share a note, and also make some private annotations.

### Alternatives
A workaround is to [embed](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Embed+files) a text block, but others will see a broken URL to your private note.

### Suggestion
an Obsidian extension to leave private comments.
- The private comments can be stored in another note, and are displayed at the bottom, under mentions.
- the plugin handles connections between note and comment with a database, and the connection is not saved in the note.
