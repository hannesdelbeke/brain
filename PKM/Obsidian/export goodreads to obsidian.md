It'd be nice to [[own your own data]] of what books I read. 
a [[backup]] in case goodreads goes down.
If I want both my data, and goodreads, the list needs to stay [[synced]]

[this blog](https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/11/exporting-goodreads-to-obsidian/) proposes either
- one-time CSV export 
- automated RSS export (You can also use the Goodsidian plugin for [[Obsidian]] , but it's limited to 100 books / shelf )

[[TODO]]
