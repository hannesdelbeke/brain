## Hashtag aliases
some hashtags should be linked to each other.
e.g. #plugin #addon #extension all mean the same thing.
But their relevant app decides what word to use within it's community.

## Solutions
options:
- move away from this, and always use plugin.
- have some kind of linked tag support: aliases for (hash)tags
  develop a plugin?
- don't use hashtags, and use note links instead.

## Hashtag purpose vs link
The use of tags is quite divided. 
- Some say to use tags for note statuses instead of linking. Since linking should always be decisive with [[wikilinks]]
- But [[Tags can help with new insights]] by finding new connections, whereas wikilinks rely on the author making the connection. Limited to their knowledge.

This [post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-guide-on-links-vs-tags-in-obsidian/28231) discusses differences between links and tags.
Overall links are better supported in [[Obsidian]] , and tags are a more primitive form of links, but without a page.
One thing you could do, is make a page for every hashtag, and use wikilinks instead of hashtags everywhere! This allows you to use aliases.

Obsidian supports [[Aliases]] for notes & links
