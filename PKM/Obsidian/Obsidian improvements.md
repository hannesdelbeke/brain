Remember plugin minimalism, less is more.
Don't spend more time on notes than work.

### I want this!
- [ ] [[obsidian web integration]] would allow for community growth
- [ ] use obsidian with separated streams of notes / submodules
	exclude download of some folders to your pc. e.g. personal / work
	ideally even exclude from the git repo, to avoid any accidental leaking of data.
	You could use another vault, but then you can't link in your master vault on your own pc.
- [ ] support for submodules, workaround to [[update submodule in obsidian]]

### low priority 
- [ ] [lazy load Obsidian plugins](https://github.com/ohm-en/obsidian-plugin-manager) seems nice but don't need it yet
- [ ] [[drag drop extract to new note]] would speed up breaking up long notes
- [ ] preview on hover URL link improves reading quick summaries
	- this site does it well [Andy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
	- obsidian supports this for notes when pressing ctrl and hover the link
	- [ ] can we have it without pressing ctrl?
- [ ] open web URLs in obsidian tab. 
	- there's a plugin that does this, but it's all or nothing
- [ ] date a note was edited (based on git)
- [ ] open note on GitHub shortcut
- [ ] spaces on tab in code blocks
- [ ] no spellcheck in links, see [bug report](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/disable-spellcheck-in-urls-and-links/50118) 
- [x] support code in dropdown [[toggle code in Obsidian]]
- [ ] add shortcut for adding to callout . select text, insert call out
