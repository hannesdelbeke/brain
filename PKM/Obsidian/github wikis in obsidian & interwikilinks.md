A plugin in the future should support linking to other vaults, without requiring that vault to use interwiki links for duplicate note names between 2 vaults.

Needed
- Obsidian interwiki-links (not allowed character in non existing note name)
  [[interwikilinks plugin]]
- GitHub interwiki links (currently shows as dead link)

ideally, we use normal wikilinks in the vault, then link that vault in obsidian.
so GitHub still uses the normal wikilinks. and a single interwiki link in my personal notes loads the other vault. which always prefers it's own wikilinks, and if not found then looks outside it's vault to the vault that referenced it.
