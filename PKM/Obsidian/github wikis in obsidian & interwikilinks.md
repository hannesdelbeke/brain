as long as there's no interwiki-links support for obsidian (and github)
make wiki links in separate vaults using normal [[wikilinks]]

Needed
- Obsidian interwiki-links (not allowed character in non existing note name)
- Github interwiki links (currently shows as dead link)

ideally, we use normal wikilinks in the vault, then link that vault in obsidian.
so github still uses the normal wikilinks. and a single interwiki link in my personal notes loads the other vault. which always prefers it's own wikilinks, and if not found then looks outside it's vault to the vault that referenced it.
