## Aliases

reddit [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/10a07wh/comment/j41oyi8/?context=3): "You can choose one as the default and in the first line of its page set aliases"
This YouTube [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdIV_69rxXI&feature=youtu.be) shows the alias feature. 
It applies to notes, not hashtags
