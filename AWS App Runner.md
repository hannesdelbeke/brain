# AWS App Runner
AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy
containerized web applications and APIs, at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required.
Start with your source code or a container image. App Runner automatically builds and deploys the web
application and load balances traffic with encryption. App Runner also scales up or down automatically
to meet your traffic needs. With App Runner, rather than thinking about servers or scaling, you have
more time to focus on your applications.
