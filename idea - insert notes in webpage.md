When I read a complex web article, e.g. https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-rule-of-x?utm_source=tldrproduct, it would be easier to understand if there were notes inserted to hover over.

Any time a note is detected, auto insert it in the text.
Example `Your Rule of X will also change`
becomes `Your [[Rule of X]] will also change`

- this breaks when the site changes, so have a side window for detached notes
- i want my notes searchable, link them to my [[Obsidian vault]] / [[Turning Obsidian into a data lake|Obsidian data lake]]
[[global search personal notes]]

[[dynamic pkm]]

- The combo of [[note taking|notes]] & a [[website]] reminds me of [[note linking duplicate source]], which describes linking to sites from in a ([[Obsidian]]) note.
