While digging through the source code I found some undocumented features (e.g. [filter](https://learn.pyblish.com/24-filtering)) (which were great, and allowed me to make [[Pyblish plugin manager]] ) 
When I contributed a PR back to the docs, I was told this was the first contribution to the docs in 5 years. In other words, nobody updated the docs.
