 
tl;dr: copy your photos from your phone to your computer instead
don't rely on photos as a backup
 
 Pros
- I only use it since it's free storage, when uploaded from [[pixel 5]]. And it integrates smoothly with the [[Google Pixel]] & [[Android]] eco system
- I like the UX, seeing cloud photos on the fly in [[Google Photos - Android App]]. And browsing my photos in the browser.

Cons
- is a pain to [[backup]], 
	- [ ] [[figure out a long term photo backup solution]]
	- [ ] maybe swap to something else in the future. [[Syncthing]] is pretty good. Perhaps can combine with [[Amazon Photos]] or [[OneDrive]].
	- [ ] how much gigs do i use on google photos as free backup? So I know how much I need when I swap service.
