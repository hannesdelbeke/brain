a icon scroll [[window (computing)|window]] has a lot in common with a [[keystroke launcher]].
They both launch apps, and both show icons.
e.g. https://ueli.app/#/

tool types with thumbnails:
- [[file browser]]
- [[tool launcher]]

Unreal
- [unreal texture browser](https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/texture-browser-unreal-plugin) 

Blender
- native [asset browser](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/asset_browser.html) asset icons & meta-data in a scroll list
- [[qt blender addon browser]] no icons but scroll list of addons
