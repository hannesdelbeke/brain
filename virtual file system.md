Instead of using an app or terminal to access your [[version control]], a Virtual File System(VFS)  lets you browse your computer like normal. Displaying files and folders from the version control server. When you open a file, it downloads the file on the fly. So you can access large repos without having to first download everything.

e.g. 
- [p4vfs](https://github.com/microsoft/p4vfs)
- Plastic SCM / Unity version control has a VFS
- GVFS: Git Virtual File System
- [gitfs](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitfs/) : git & Android 
- microsoft [VFSForGit](https://github.com/microsoft/VFSForGit) (Archived), surpassed by [scalar](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar), which moved to [microsoft-git](https://github.com/microsoft/git)
