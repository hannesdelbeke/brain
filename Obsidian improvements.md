Remember plugin minimalism, less is more.
Don't spend more time on notes than work.

### I want this!
- [ ] [[obsidian git backup can fail]]
- [ ] [[Obsidian web integration]] would allow for community growth
- [ ] use obsidian with separated streams of notes / submodules (submodule have issues)
	exclude download of some folders to your pc. e.g. personal / work
	ideally even exclude from the git repo, to avoid any accidental leaking of data.
	You could use another vault, but then you can't link in your master vault on your own pc.
	- [ ] proposal: [[interwikilinks plugin]]
- [ ] [[Obsidian private comments]], allowing private local comments that don't live in the note
- [ ] ability edit obsidian vault online, in the browser
	- [ ] action to auto sync from gitwiki to repo
- [ ] right click and button hover show short keys, [thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/adding-shortcuts-to-the-right-click-context-menu/46160) 
- [ ] [[note linking duplicate source]]
- [ ] color a orange border around a note, if the note is unlinked
- [x] improve [[navigate sibling page]], next & previous button
- [x] automatic support for submodules, workaround for manually pulling and pushing submodules., see [[Obsidian submodule]]
- [x] [[Obsidian auto collapse linked mentions]] (Work around)

my own workflow improvements, not related to obsidian
- [ ] [[minimize pkm image size]]
- [ ] [[link unlinked noted]]
- [ ] [[discover a garden's essence]]
### low priority 
- [ ] [[drag drop extract to new note]] would speed up breaking up long notes
- [ ] support folders starting with `.` see forum [post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/enable-use-of-hidden-files-and-folders-starting-with-a-dot-dotfiles-dotfolders-within-obsidian/26908)
      some md files, think from azure, use `.attachments` by default. works on github but in Obsidian 
- [ ] preview on hover URL link improves reading quick summaries
	- this site does it well [Andy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
	- obsidian supports [page preview for notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Page+preview) when pressing ctrl and hover the link
	- [x] can we have it without pressing ctrl?
	      instructions to enable [[automatic preview on hover URL]]
	- [ ] preview external URLs [forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/show-preview-on-hover-over-external-link-e-g-to-a-webpage/9104)
- [ ] quickly see the date when a note was edited in Obsidian 
	- [x] from file created metadata, see [file info panel](https://github.com/CattailNu/obsidian-file-info-panel-plugin) plugin, not quickly though
	- [ ] from git
	ideal would be a small text above the title. or at bottom of file
- [ ] a shortcut to open a note on GitHub
	if you store the repo on git, then enable a shortcut in [[Obsidian]] to go to the note in the repo in the browser. hide button if no git detected
- [ ] spaces on tab in code blocks option (for Python)
- [ ] no spellcheck in links, see [bug report](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/disable-spellcheck-in-urls-and-links/50118) 
- [ ] add shortcut for adding to callout . select text, insert call out
- [ ] [[Obsidian plugin - Tabber]] 
- [ ] if 'Files' is open, and I click on 'Files' again. I expect the side tab to collapse.
- [ ] [[Obsidian auto complete]]
- [ ] first define iframe height, then width. Else height won't work.  [forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/iframe/14296/20)
- [ ] exclude folders, e.g. daily folder, from backlinks
	- [ ] Settings > Files & Links > Excluded files
- [x] support code in dropdown, workaround: [[Obsidian toggle code]]
- [x] open web URLs in obsidian tab.  https://github.com/MamoruDS/obsidian-open-link-with
- [x] [[Obsidian quick move]] the current note to a folder
- [x] [[Obsidian distinguish internal & external links]]

dropped notes because not important
- [ ] [[Obsidian improve callout formatting]]
