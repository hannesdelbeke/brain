some very messy notes


## Goal

### Pros:
- host shared notes
	- some notes in my vault could live on the web. 
		e.g. my dev-notes can be useful to others.
		see [[digital garden examples]]

	- link to other people's vaults. create a community of knowledge
	  stack exchange, reddit, … show the power of this
- no need for software download/install (restrictions), discussed in [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/uf0u9e/comment/i789eam) and this [obsidian thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-for-web/2049)

### existing solutions 


the best solution so far appears to be a [[static site generator]] for [[GitHub pages]]
dynamic render uses JavaScript which might be an issue, but no html generation needed


### static
- [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) generates sites from markdown with python, [GitHub](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) ⭐15k
	- python!
	- static site generator
	- [tutorial](https://blog.elmah.io/hosting-a-mkdocs-driven-documentation-site-on-github-pages/) GitHub pages
	- [material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) is a theme for mkdocs, ⭐12k
	templates
	- [ ] https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs
		- wikilinks
		- github page
	- [ ] [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/vql2yi/mkdocs_and_obsidian_templates/) reddit thread wants a update if I find a easy solution
	- [ ] [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/z01c7j/is_there_anyway_to_host_markdown_files_online/j0p8ine/?context=3) post too
	- [ ] https://github.com/Jackiexiao/foam-mkdocs-template looks good, full GitHub page instructions
	- [x] [obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-template)
		- neat UI, dark theme option
		- supports comments at bottom of post using [giscus](https://github.com/giscus)
		- requires a obsidian plugin, not a full CICD pipeline
- [x] Jekyll was one of the first site generators, has lots of support but a bit slow and dated
	about:
		In 2021, Jekyll developer said that **the Jekyll codebase "is in frozen mode and permanent hiatus**" and recommended users whose needs are not met by the frozen state of Jekyll to move to Eleventy
		- static generator
	a [tutorial](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/misc/jekyll-ghpages/lesson/) on jekyll & github pages
	templates
		- [gitbook](https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/jekyll/2019-04-27-why.html), 
		- [template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) 500⭐
			- preview hover
			- wikilinks
		- [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) with instructions
			- [x] 1.  Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
			- [x]  Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
			- [x]  Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
			- [ ]  Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io/) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
			- [ ]  Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
			- [ ]  Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
			- [ ]  (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.
	- [x] simple-Jekyll template for obsidian [repo](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link), [forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/notenote-link-publish-your-obsidian-notes-with-jekyll-for-free/7951) supporting wikilinks
- [ ] [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is the new faster brother of Jekyll, supposed to be easy to use
	- With Eleventy, you can specify a markdown parser to supports wikilinks. [markdown-it-wikilinks](https://github.com/kwvanderlinde/markdown-it-wikilinks)
	- [template](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden)
- [ ] [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is a fast doc generator written in Rust
	- open source
	- dark theme
	- markdown
	- supports plugins, suggestions [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23324598#23363574)
- [x] Netifly is a hosting/build service, similar to GitHub pages
- [x] lettersmith
	- techy template https://github.com/kmcgillivray/obsidian-lettersmith
		- support wikilinks
- [x] Docusaurus
	- nice [tutorial](https://baky0905.github.io/personal-website/blog/2021/04/02/docusaurus/)
		  [![](https://baky0905.github.io/personal-website/assets/images/landing-a7871b64daf45f3b12ca13d22e39cde8.png)]
	  was able to get tutorial to work
  - no wiki links, feature request [thread](https://docusaurus.io/feature-requests/p/support-link-thumbnail-card)
- Zola
  - [x] [obsidian-zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola) easy turn a git repo into a website, adding only 1 file
		- bad UI
		- requires a [netifly](https://www.netlify.com/) site, seems to be jekyll 
			- sign in w github account
- [MindStone](https://github.com/TuanManhCao/digital-garden)
	supports wikilinks, graph, ...
	looks pretty decent
	think it's an indie project so lots of bugs.
	
### dynamic
- [x] [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify)
	Docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. 
	- it doesn't generate static html files like GitBook, 
	- it displays your Markdown files as a website
	- [tutorial](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/docsify-js-tutorial/#/) 
	- it's not SEO friendly, just like github md preview, use static instead for this
	- works well
	- **no wikilinks** support, 
		wikilinks [plugin](https://github.com/zpengg/docsify-wikilink) , works partially
		- no support for images
		- no support for filename paths in other folders
	- https://docsify-this.net/#/ 
		load public md files with docsify through a 3rd part website
		just pass the URL e.g. to the GitHub .MD file
- GitHub
	- pages can just live in root, no extra clutter
	- easy PR community, online editor
	- no google crawl
- [x] [blot.im](https://blot.im/how/configure)
	- compatible w obsidian
	- 4$ a month
	- no wikilinks
### unsorted
- [ ] tiddlywiki - a stable wiki solution
	
- [x] [docker image](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-remote-running-obsidian-in-docker-with-browser-based-access/34312/3) of obsidian, seems advanced
	- [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/sy3x92/accessing_my_obsidian_notes_in_the_browser/) going over more docker
- [Quartz/Hugo](https://fulcra.design/Notes/Start-publishing-my-notes) interesting task list from a dev describing the creation of his site
	- https://gohugo.io/
		- hugo is faster than jekyll
	- compatible with obsidian if you use meta data on top.
	  YAML title, date, and lastmod field
	  - [video](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/blogging-with-hugo-and-github-pages/) tut on hugo 
- [ ]  checkout obsidian thread https://forum.obsidian.md/t/static-site-generators-any-guides/8915
- [ ] this [blogpost](https://www.kez.ie/notes/choosing%20the%20right%20platform%20to%20create%20a%20public%20digital%20garden/) discusses solutions, and shares feeling overwhelmed. they settled on Eleventy

### Start publishing my notes

https://fulcra.design/Notes/Start-publishing-my-notes
Thinking it through Sept. 16, 2022 I'm currently publishing via Blot. It's an excellent service and has recently launched support for ...

other

- a template [script](https://fulcra.design/) to add meta data to your notes Q.Q
  YAML title, date, and lastmod field. This facilitates integration with Quartz/Hugo. It requires MetaEdit

##### pure markdown readers
- browse repo on github
- [markdown viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en) chrome extension
	- works barebones
	- issues:
		- no side bar
		- no filename title
		- no wiki links to other .md files
		- (minor issue) no plugins 
			- no backup (git) 
			- no search
			- no tags
- [ ] look into this chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-web/edoacekkjanmingkbkgjndndibhkegad) to search notes for a webpage

### make my own solution
#todo 

- [x]  [[Create a site with mkdocs]]
- [x] [docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/adding-a-git-repository/#repository-icon) add edit btn
- [x] wikilinks
- [x] auto build git action
- [x] transfer other branch action
- [ ] setup submodules for clean approach?
- [ ] test with this 3rd party [repo](https://github.com/bralkor/unreal_python_recipe_book?tab=readme-ov-file) and make a PR showing of the build site, see [[Github markdown to site]]

hashtag support to material
- update [this issue](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2087#issuecomment-1272116074) if solution is found
- material supports tags in note header, not same convention as obsidian, [docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-tags/#tag-icons-and-identifiers), [testpage](http://127.0.0.1:8000/folder1/tags/#hashtag1)

goal: a repo you can clone, and all you need to change is settings/drop docs folder in.
option to submodule it.
bonus:
provide link to your notes repo, submodule, auto set settings.

- take a mkdocs template
- only obsidian notes on main (and github workflow)
- workflow copies files to documentation 
- documentation copies files to gh-pages

optional
- [ ] ability to only add github workflow, pulls documentation from hannes repo and sets up new branch
- [ ] support submodules pull latest



- [ ] find a solution to implement this.
- [ ] if notes are in URLs, how can a note be renamed without changing the URL.
	This would break links.
	notion uses a GUID
	[Andy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J&stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C&stackedNotes=z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1) uses some kind of GUIDs, good reference
- [ ] edit on the web
	to support non-tech community
	no need to know git
- [ ] preview on hover, see [Andy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
	- obsidian supports this when pressing ctrl, try it: [[Obsidian improvements]]
#obsidian #notes

Obsidian is running Electron, which apparently is easy to port to the web

challenges
- wiki links not by default supported in markdown
- requires a "root" defined.
	- links are just name of doc, doesn't include folder paths
	- so needs a database?

goals
- avoid plugins that add non default markdown to file (e.g. special header info)
- easy UX to edit and auto/easy backup notes
- collapsible lists

### about obsidian
obsidian has a REST API
	test it [here](https://coddingtonbear.github.io/obsidian-local-rest-api/)
	access e.g. active page through code
	req: the obsidian app needs to be open
