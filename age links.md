It'd be great if links could age, resulting in some kind of dynamic [[Link strength]].
- Often clicked links grow stronger.
- Rarely clicked [[link|links]] and unread [[note taking|notes]] grow weaker
This approach simulates neuron connections in the brain, and since often [[evolution already figured out the optimal algorithm]] this might be the best approach to link data.

Then the next step would be to figure out how [[Link strength]] can be [[visualize|visualized]] .
