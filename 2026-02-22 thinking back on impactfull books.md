There are a few books I think of as very impactful or memorable. Let's see what I remembered after the years. (likely the core message of the book)

---
- [[Negotiate like your life depends on it]]
	- you can be empathetic without agreeing. e.g. It seems you were wronged.
	- mirror people by repeating their last 3 words to create rapport.
	- paraphrase in own words
	- people like to be understood, repeating does this better than agreeing.
	- the word fair is very loaded, people use it in negotiating.
	- don't use the word but, it undoes your entire previous sentence.
	- don't use a shit sandwich, start with the bad, then the good.
	- don't skip the small talk, actively listen to their boring rant often is faster to move the conversation on and not have people repeat themselves because they felt you didn't understood them.

maybe from Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships — Daniel Goleman
- ...
	- if you pay attention to the emotions of the person you speak too, you'll remember more.
	- humans are primed to mirror others with mirror neurons. You can put yourself in someone's else situation, and think what they would think.

maybe from **_Thinking, Fast and Slow_ — Daniel Kahneman**
...
- humans have 2 brain modes. social, and logical. the more logical tasks you do the more your emotional brain switches off, and vice versa.

[[Supercommunicators - How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection]]
- people who can control their emotions more, are more successful, and have a bigger social circle.
- everyone wants the maximum emotional experience for themselves, but the most logical for others around them. But people restrain themselves to not be seen as a bad member of society. Emotional control therefor is good for society, since it's what others like from you.

- [[No Rules Rules - Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention|netflix book]] 
	- give people unlimited holiday, and creative freedom. don't track receipts, trust people. This leads to the best outcomes.
	- only hire top talent, ensure [[talent density]]
	- pay top salary to maintain top talent. always pay more than competition.
Netflix recently stopped doing many of the above, tightening the belt, since inflation rose and money wasn't free anymore.

[[Algorithms to Live By]]
- the most recent thing is the most relevant - best way to calculate [[optimized cache sorting]], best way to predict the future, is assuming the same as the most recent.
- set a deadline, or decide on a number of options, check out 2/3rds of your options before deciding to get a baseline, then decide and pick the first one that is equal or better than the baseline (e.g. the top 10% you saw before). 
  [[Secretary Problem]]

### Summary
I mostly remember that Humans are emotional, and want to be understood. 
Also that the secret to happiness is other people, since we are social, and staying busy doing things.

If you make people feel good, you get better at negotiating, and making friends. 
TLDR: focus on pleasing people around you, and you will be happier, and more successful.

the example from the book ... sticked with me the most: A person with anxiety and job issues was happier late in life, than a successful lawyer with hot wife, because they shared their struggles with others in church. And the lawyer kept it to himself, and didn't even share with his wife.

I read a lot of business self help books, the ones related to emotions and conversation seem the most relevant, sticking with me the longest.

## What I forgot

# 🔥 **Never Split the Difference (Chris Voss)**

You remembered the rapport‑building tools, but you forgot the **strategic** ones — the parts that make the book more than empathy hacks.

### **Forgotten lessons**

- **Calibrated questions**  
    “How am I supposed to do that?”  
    These shift the burden of problem‑solving to the other side.
    
- **Accusation Audit**  
    List every negative thing they might say about you _before_ they say it.  
    This disarms them instantly.
    
- **Labeling emotions**  
    “It seems like…”  
    “It sounds like…”  
    You remembered empathy, but not the _mechanism_ Voss uses to surface hidden motivations.
    
- **The 7‑38‑55 rule**  
    7% words, 38% tone, 55% body language.  
    Voss uses this to justify why tone is more important than content.
    
- **The “Late‑night FM DJ voice”**  
    Slow, calm, downward‑inflected tone to defuse tension.
    
- **No‑oriented questions**  
    People feel safer saying “no” than “yes.”  
    (“Is now a bad time?”)
    
- **The “Black Swan” concept**  
    Hidden unknowns that change the entire negotiation once revealed.

# 🔥 **Supercommunicators (Charles Duhigg)**

You remembered emotional control and social reward structures.  
What’s missing is the **core model** of communication types.

### **Forgotten lessons**

- **There are three types of conversations:**
    1. **Practical** (solving a problem)
    2. **Emotional** (seeking understanding)
    3. **Social** (negotiating identity, status, belonging)
    Most conflicts come from mismatching the type.
    
- **Looping for understanding**  
    A structured technique:
    1. Ask a question
    2. Paraphrase
    3. Check if you got it right  
        This is the backbone of “supercommunication.”
    
- **People reveal identity bids constantly**  
    (“I’m the kind of person who…”)  
    Responding to these builds deep trust.
    
- **High‑quality questions**  
    Questions that invite stories, not facts.
    
- **Emotional generosity**  
    The idea that connection is built by _over‑responding_ positively to others’ emotional disclosures.

---

# 🔥 **No Rules Rules (Netflix)**

You remembered the cultural headlines.  
What’s missing is the **mechanics** of how Netflix made this work.

### **Forgotten lessons**

- **Freedom only works with extreme candor**  
    Radical candor is the _foundation_ of talent density.  
    Without it, freedom becomes chaos.
    
- **The “Keeper Test”**  
    Managers ask:  
    _“If this person resigned, would I fight to keep them?”_  
    If not, they get a generous severance.
    
- **Context, not control**  
    Leaders don’t give rules — they give context so people can make good decisions autonomously.
    
- **Sunshining mistakes**  
    Publicly sharing your own failures to normalize learning.
    
- **Global talent arbitrage**  
    [[Netflix]] pays top‑of‑market _per individual_, not per role or location.
    
- **The “No Brilliant Jerks” rule**  
    [[Talent density]] collapses if you tolerate toxic high performers.

# 🔥 **Algorithms to Live By**

You remembered the optimal stopping rule and recency bias.  
What’s missing are the **other algorithms** that shape everyday decisions.

### **Forgotten lessons**

- **Explore vs Exploit**  
    Early in a process: explore widely.  
    Later: exploit what works.  
    (Applies to dating, restaurants, career choices.)
    
- **The “Clean Desk” is mathematically inefficient**  
    Messy piles are often optimal because sorting has a cost.
    
- **Caching and prefetching**  
    Your brain (and your life) benefit from preparing for predictable future tasks.
    
- **Overfitting**  
    Don’t optimize your life around rare events or edge cases.
    
- **Scheduling by “Shortest Processing Time”**  
    Do the quickest tasks first to reduce total waiting time.
    
- **The power of randomness**  
    Randomized strategies outperform deterministic ones in adversarial environments.
    
- **The “[[Secretary Problem]]” is only one chapter**  
    The book is full of other decision‑making heuristics you likely forgot.

# 🧠 **What your memory pattern reveals**

You consistently remember:

- emotional principles
- social dynamics
- human behavior
- stories
- interpersonal techniques

And you tend to forget:

- structural frameworks
- algorithms
- decision models
- meta‑strategies
- the “why it works” layer

This is actually a _strength_: you retain the parts that shape how you interact with people.
