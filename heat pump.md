similar to [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|HVAC]] since it controls temperature.
usually replaces a boiler

X to water heatpump can't cool down because of condensation on the radiators.
air to air heatpump = aircon

- UK [requirements](https://check-mark.co.uk/info/plan/planning-permission/) to avoid the need for planning permission:
	- The relevant legislation is [Part 14 G of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 ![Opens in a new window](https://check-mark.co.uk/images/external-link.svg "Opens in a new window")](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/schedule/2/part/14/crossheading/class-g-installation-or-alteration-etc-of-air-source-heat-pumps-on-domestic-premises/paragraph/G)  (use the /previous/next paragraph buttons).
	- summary:
		- It must comply with MCS planning standards - see [Noise and neighbours](https://check-mark.co.uk/info/plan/planning-permission/noise-neighbours/ "Noise and neighbours").
		- Only one air source heat pump for the property. A block of flats usually counts as one property.
		- Must be more than 1m from property boundaries.
		- Must be more than 1m from the edge of a flat roof. Not on a pitched roof.
	- terraced homeowners may need planning permission for heat pumps

placement
avoid placing near the corners of a building.
Because cold air bounces back from the wall and go behind the unit reducing the average temperature of the air that heat is being extracted from (making the heat pump less efficient).

[article](https://nef.org.uk/can-i-get-my-hot-water-from-an-air-source-heat-pump/) on using heat pump not only for heating water, but for hot water e.g. shower, bath,  
- to avoid [[Legionella]] need to heat water to 60
	- electric immersion heater in [[hot water cylinder]] (simplest solution)
	- hybrid system
	- heat battery
	- [[Instantaneous water heater]]
	- high-temperature heat pump (expensive)

heat pumps can be more than 100% efficient. 
e.g. 300% means for every 1kW you put in, you get 3kW of cooling. (since you don't cool, you just move energy)
