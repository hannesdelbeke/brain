[[Bitwarden-]] doesn't let you create more than 2 organisations on a free account. 
But you can make multiple accounts, and invite yourself as a non admin member to these free organisations.
(Ensure your IT company policy allows this, or ask your IT department first)
## steps
- create a private Bitwarden account
- create a Bitwarden account with your work email
- create an organization with your work Bitwarden.
- invite your private account to the work organization
### result
- you now can access all your passwords from 1 master account, and they are organized by organization.
- And on your [[work pc]], you can log in with just your work Bitwarden. This ensures any company monitoring, never can access your private passwords.
