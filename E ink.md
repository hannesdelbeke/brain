Waveshare, the cheapest e ink monitor 300-500GBP [link](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/eink-disp.htm)

## e ink lifespan
It has a long life if you never refresh the screen... Which is what happens in a traditional eink tablet... It'll refresh only you advance to the next page.

But when you use it as a monitor, it refreshes practically everytime you move the mouse.
