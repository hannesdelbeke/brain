internal blinds stop the light from coming in.

if the light comes through double or triple glass, and then is reflected back outside. a lot of energy stays inside.

often blinds such as roll blinds have an opening at the top and bottom where air can go through. this creates a chimney stack effect since the air between the blind and window is heated up. hot air rises and pulls in cold air in the bottom. just like a [[rocket stove]]
