rolling out tools to users.

- use versioning and support rolling back to prevent rolling out a compile error breaking the user's environment
- offer easy updating, since users can't be assumed to be technical (e.g. artists)
- are all tools setup the same on users' pcs? (e.g. a tool [[monorepo]] hosted on [[git]]), 
  or can users pick and choose, creating their own environment (e.g. [[plugget]]?
- How well documented is the whole process?
- How easy is it to set up the tool distribution, is it a 1 click process?
