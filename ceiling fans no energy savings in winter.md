### Heat over winter
Unclear how effective their use is over winter in reverse, blowing back hot air at near ceiling.
Likely no energy savings
### Research
- Ceiling fans on low settings do not produce wind chill in winter. [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/154193128302700821?journalCode=prob)
- Big Ass Fans [claims](https://bigassfans.com/press-releases/big-ass-fans-exposes-failings-reversing-ceiling-fans-winter/) reversing ceiling fans in the winter recirculates heat but creates drafts.
  Traditional paddle fans don't effectively circulate heated air at a low speed, and at a high speed create a draft.
  Possible bias: Big ass fans is a fan manufacturer
