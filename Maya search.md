A command [[search bar]] added in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] 2022
![[Maya search-1761664071201.jpeg]]

open:
- press `CTRL + F`
- or go to the menu Help > Search bar

extend
- To show your custom command in Maya search, see [[Maya runTimeCommand from menu]] 
### Pros
- instantly launch your tools by name (includes all default menu items)
### Cons
- no [[favorite|favoriting]] ⭐
- no auto include of all menu items like [[Unity search]]. Custom [[Maya menu|menu]] items aren't included in the search result, affecting menu commands added by plugins. This is unintuitive for the user.

> [!note]
> After trying to use Maya search in production, it still feels department lists (environment, characters, animation, ...) and favoriting is an important missing feature. There still is a need for a [[tool launcher]]. (2025)

> [!tip]
> Many people still don't know about Maya search. Perhaps add an info panel to your studios tool launcher to remind artists. Ideally they work in sync. (2025)

> [!warning]
> mel commands like `buildFileMenu` are not included in search

### 3rd party
Because Maya search ships with Maya, I recommend it over these 3rd party tools.
- [[Maya quick launcher]]
- [[Maya Cosmos]]
### Tags
[[keystroke launcher]]
[[dcc search bar]]
