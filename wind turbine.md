#### Horizontal-axis turbines
traditional wind mill design
uses rudder

- no planning permission needed [source](https://www.planningaid.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/203144402-Domestic-wind-turbine)
- but [source](https://mcscertified.com/technology/small-wind-turbines/) says plan permission is needed
#### Vertical-axis turbines
catches wind from any direction
AFAIK better, more modern design


## pros
- smaller footprint than solar
- works during night, or cloudy days
- more efficient (50%) than solar (20%) 
- production is better for planet
## cons
- regular maintenance
- visual & noise impact
- horizontal-axis turbine blades kill birds
- doesn't work on windless day
