- [[intrinsic motivation]]
- **Extrinsic Motivation** involves external rewards, such as [[money]], praise, or prizes. Good for simple, straightforward tasks, but financial incentives can hinder performance on complex problems requiring creative solutions. 

Key Concepts
- **Undermining Effect:** Research in Self-Determination Theory suggests that offering significant external rewards for activities people already enjoy can sometimes reduce their intrinsic motivation, as the focus shifts from the internal enjoyment to the external reward.
- **Performance Impact:**
    - financial incentives improves performance for tasks with clear rules and a single clear path to success by narrowing focus.
    - For "candle problems" (tasks requiring "out-of-the-box" thinking), financial rewards can lead to worse performance because the pressure and focus on the reward can restrict creative problem-solving.
- **Long-Term Engagement:** Intrinsic motivators, like a sense of purpose and personal growth, tend to foster more lasting and meaningful engagement compared to monetary rewards which often only have a short-term impact.
- **Fairness Perception:** Money is a motivator, but once people feel they are paid fairly, they tend to be driven more by non-monetary factors like autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
