We can create [[URL]] shortcuts in our [[Obsidian vault|vault]]. Kinda like what [[google drive]] does.
It stores a file on my pc, but when I click it, it opens it in the web. e.g. `gdoc`.
I used this to [[embed Google Drive folder in Obsidian|embed Google Drive files in my Obsidian vault]] so I can [[wikilink]] them in my notes with [[Obsidian autocomplete]].

- works with [[obsidian autocomplete]], since it's just another file in the vault.
- we can set up separate syncers, strava, github, [[google contacts]], ...

cons
- but it's not yet a personal data link system. it only focusses on Obsidian

[[2026-02-21 example sync contact scenario]]
google contacts uses a UID. can we use aliases for non obsidian files?

The only thing this would achieve, 
- is creating a nickname for a URL.
- track [[Obsidian backlinks]]. However we can't see backlinks for files that you can't open in [[Obsidian]] except for in the [[Obsidian graph view]].
- add autocomplete support, which is actually quite useful.

The note [[note linking duplicate source]] describes this same issue for websites.
How we don't have backlinks to websites, and need a note to act as a middleman.

But we can open URLs in Obsidian, so if you log in you could see backlinks in the side panel. However, atm Obsidian doesn't has the best browsing experience.
And I can't log in my google account in Obsidian.

An external browser app to show backlinks would be better. It could also work with other apps like my [[integrated development environment|IDE]].

conclusion, i focus too much on backlinks, but autocomplete would be a great addon.
