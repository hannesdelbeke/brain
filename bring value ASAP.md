## bring value ASAP
Often it's better to develop a prototype exporter that works 90% in 1 day, 
than to have an exporter that works 100% in a month.

Bring maximum value as soon as possible to the team.
You can always tell the user, if this problem happens, read the docs which explain how to get around the problem. 
Aiming for [[perfection]] will instead result in delays, and the tool might not even be needed anymore.
Then when the tool is in use, you can focus on bringing it from 90% -> 100%.
And meanwhile you might get some great user feedback.
