> [!INFO]- EVs have less mileage at high speed (motorway)
> unlike a gas-powered vehicle, an EV's consumption increases dramatically as speeds rise. Of course, as with all cars, aerodynamic drag inflates with the square of speed, but EVs are particularly affected as all but the Audi e-tron GT and Porsche Taycan lack multiple gears. So, a higher vehicle speed means the electric motor is spinning at a faster and less efficient point.
