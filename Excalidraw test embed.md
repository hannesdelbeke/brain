the `.excalidraw.md` file can be moved to another folder, 
and [auto export](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/publish-with-embedded-excalidraw-drawing/54288/2) also auto moves the svg. 
so we are not limited to 1 folder, and can support public and private images in the same vault

- [ ] does [[MkDocs]] support `.excalidraw` links?
if not replace with `.svg`.
currently i see no reason to embed  `.excalidraw`
