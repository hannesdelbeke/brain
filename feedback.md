Feedback is often known as communication on how to improve.
But it can also be positive feedback, which helps people know what they are doing well and should keep doing.

Feedback is a signal that tells you how you are doing. This signal can be negative, like pain telling you to not touch fire. Or positive, like compliments when you do something nice.
When you are hurt in a game, the xbox controller vibrating and the sound effect are the feedback.

Something that feels [[intuitive]] often feels that way because there is a lot of feedback.
e.g. when in a videogame there are coins that when picked up provide a nice sound effect, it will feel intuitive to walk that way.
