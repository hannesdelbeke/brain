## Increasing factors
Endotoxin concentrations increased with 
- children or more occupants 
- dogs
- lower educational attainment
- living in poverty
- observed food debris
- cockroach infestation
- cigarette smoking. 
- stuffed animals in bed
- an [[impermeable]] mattress cover
## Unrelated factors
In contrast to indoor [[mold|molds]] and [[dust mites|mite]] allergens, endotoxin was not associated with the following:
factors that don't influence endotoxin levels in a home
- [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|air conditioning]]
