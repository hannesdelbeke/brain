- Summarize knowledge
- [[writing]] knowledge into notes to remember more than your [[brain]] can handle
- writing about something is like [[rubber duck programming]], it will make concepts more clear, more defined. Similar to how teaching others solidifies your own knowledge. It identifies knowledge gaps.
