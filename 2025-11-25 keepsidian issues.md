i tried [[Obsidian-keepsidian]]
it works but 
- you can't delete notes and sync the deletion back
- to process a note, 
	- I need to delete it from the keep folder in both google keep and my vault.
	- then make a dupe note in my vault
This is a lot of work, i might be better off just copy pasting from keep and deleting it in there.

Ideally:
- an [[AI agent]] processes my notes and adds them into my vault.
	- then deletes the keep note once processed.
- option to ignore notes in keep, e.g. my shopping list.
