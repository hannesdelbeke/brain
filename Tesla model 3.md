seats down : 67/75 inches - 170/190 cm

### reddit measurement
so 930mm wide,
**440mm high** is from floor to the cross member in the top of the boot, 
and 1700mm long if a 6’2” person is driving. You could prob easy fit 1800 or even 1900 if you wanted to drive clown car style

I personally would reduce that max height to say 400mm as you need room to manoeuvre the package over the boot lip if that makes sense….
