seats down : 67/75 inches - 170/190 cm

### reddit measurement
so 930mm wide, **440mm high** is from floor to the cross member in the top of the boot, and 1700mm long if a 6’2” person is driving. You could prob easy fit 1800 or even 1900 if you wanted to drive clown car style

I personally would reduce that max height to say 400mm as you need room to manoeuvre the package over the boot lip if that makes sense….

Hope this helps. Oh and these are the dimensions of a 22’ M3LR.
