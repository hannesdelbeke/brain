144 W max continuous draw with a [[12 V car‑socket inverter]]
reported to get extremely hot
newer models have 15v, which might error with some inverters.
The cigarette plug offers DC, inverter converts to AC ([[electricity socket]])
if you charge a laptop, it usually converts to DC again, so it's inefficient.
Try charge directly from 12v USB-C car charger instead.

## Power outlet
The power outlet is suitable for accessories requiring up to 12A continuous draw (16A peak)
For vehicles manufactured after approximately November 2021, power inverters plugged into the low voltage power outlet must support 16V DC input to function.

Older cars (≈13 V × 12 A)
≈ 156 W max
Newer cars (≈16 V × 12 A)
≈ 192 W max
After inverter losses (10–20%), you get: 120–160 W

The USB ports can output power up to approximately 15W
Wireless Phone Charger is 15W
