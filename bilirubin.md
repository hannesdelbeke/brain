Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of [[haemoglobin]] (which
carries [[oxygen]] around the body in red blood cells). It is removed
from the body by the liver and then stored and concentrated in the
gallbladder. It is secreted into the intestine (bowel) and removed
from the body in urine and faeces.
