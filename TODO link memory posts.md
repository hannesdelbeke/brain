### Instagram
[[instagram]], to look back on memories. There's a [[memory post]] for every day of a fun event, often traveling related.

- [ ] I wish I could use links to other instagram posts. E.g. show me all posts from when I was in Ghent.
- I link to the concept of Ghent, or the location. e.g. an obsidian note currently, but maybe a different "link" tech stack in the future
- I click on Ghent, it shows me all contacts from Ghent, all pictures from Ghent, all my notes referencing Ghent.
- I filter down to get more specific, e.g. all photos in Ghent after 2025

[[Google Photos]] is great, but it doesn't sort my pics like that. Instead, it contains all my pics as backup of that day, which is overwhelming. 100 pics, vs a few highlights of the best pics. It also often doesn't has post-processing applies, corrected colors, straight horizon, crop etc
