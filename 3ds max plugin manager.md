Disabling a 3ds max plugin doesn't delete its menu in max (e.g. `civil view`).
Whereas maya and blender have option to run code on disable, cleaning up the menu. There's no callback or hook on disabling a plugin.

It also seems to re enable disabled plugins on max restart. I don't know when someone can disable a plugin. It seems they are all loaded on startup.
