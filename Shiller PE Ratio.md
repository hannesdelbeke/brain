The **Shiller PE Ratio** (or **CAPE**) is a valuation metric for the stock market that adjusts for inflation and smooths out earnings over a 10-year period. 

$$
\text{CAPE} = \frac{\text{Current Price of the S\&P 500}}{\text{Average Inflation-Adjusted Earnings over the past 10 years}}
$$

This ratio is often used to assess whether the stock market is overvalued or undervalued **relative to historical norms**.
