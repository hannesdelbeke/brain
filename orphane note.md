An orphane note is a note that has no links to another note, and therefore is undiscoverable.

Notes with links cans still be undiscoverable:
If a few notes link to each other, but non of those notes link to the rest of the notes, it's never possible to reach these few notes. 
It's like having 2 separated [[network|networks]], that are not connected with each other.
