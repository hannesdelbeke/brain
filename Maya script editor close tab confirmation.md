In Maya's script editor,  to [[close tab]] you can middle mouse click it.
A popup shows asking if you want to delete this tab, this is a bit annoying, and doesn't happen in other apps like [[Chrome]], [[Obsidian]], [[PyCharm]] and other [[integrated development environment|IDEs]].

it'd be nicer to not have the popup show up.
and have ctrl+shift+T to reopen the last closed tab, and include the contents of the tab.
also ctrl+T to open a new tab would be nice.
