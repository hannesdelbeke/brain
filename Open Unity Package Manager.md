uses java, runs outside of unity
not compatible with [[Unity scoped registries]] ??? unsure.
### **OpenUPM**
🔹 **What it is:**
- A scoped registry for Unity’s built-in **[[Unity Package Manager]] (UPM)**.
- Hosts open-source Unity packages, allowing you to install and update them easily within Unity’s package system.

🔹 **Pros:**  
✅ Fully compatible with Unity's Package Manager.  
✅ Provides Unity-specific libraries, tools, and plugins (e.g., Odin Serializer, Addressables extensions).  
✅ No external tooling required—integrates directly into Unity workflows.  
✅ Supports scoped registries, making it easy to manage multiple package sources.

🔹 **Cons:**  
❌ Smaller library selection compared to NuGet (mostly Unity-related packages).  
❌ Some packages might not be actively maintained.
## other
For installing libraries, you migth want to check out [[NuGetForUnity]] and [[Unity NuGet]] instead of openUPM
