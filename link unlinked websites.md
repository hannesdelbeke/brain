you browse a public website, e.g. a documentation page, and come across a term you don't understand. If only the site used [[wikilink]] !

Imagine a chrome extension similar to [[URL textlink]], that let's you:
1. select a word
2. right click, and click "search reference"
3. launch your favorite search engine, find a site explaining the concept
4. click the extension button, to inform that you found the reference
this will hookup the ref to the website, and bring you back to the original page.
it now will look and act like an URL, 

your custom URLs can be uploaded to git or some other provider. 
and shared with the community.
I can follow my friend Bob, and now will see all his custom references on a public site. Allowing teams to collaborate on a research project, or study together.

---------
Extend on this idea:
Allow better tutorial links. I can provide a link to a website, and add links to certain elements in that website. Then my link auto loads the custom URLs that go with my tutorial.
