# AWS Budgets
AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed
(or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set RI utilization
or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. RI
alerts support Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon ElastiCache reservations.
Budgets can be tracked at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and
end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as
AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. Budget alerts can be sent via email and/or Amazon Simple
Notification Service (SNS) topic.
Budgets can be created and tracked from the AWS Budgets dashboard or via the Budgets API.
AWS Cost & Usage Report
The AWS Cost & Usage Report is a single location for accessing comprehensive information about your
AWS costs and usage.
The AWS Cost & Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service category used by an account and its
IAM users in hourly or daily line items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation
purposes. You can also customize the AWS Cost & Usage Report to aggregate your usage data to the
daily or monthly level.
