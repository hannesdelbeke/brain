[[operators optimizing for optics - story]]

While the details surely vary, stories of this shape are, at any given time, playing out in most tech companies I know. 

Mind you, this is not just at “bad companies”. Some of the very best tech companies in the world have their share of Operators like Dan and projects like Zeus.

3 types of product leaders
- The [[operators optimizing for optics - Operator|Operator]]
- The [[operators optimizing for optics - Craftsperson|Craftsperson]]
- The [[operators optimizing for optics - Visionary|Visionary]]

And frankly Dan isn’t the only culpable party here. 

Everyone, from Alice & Bob at the top, to Acme’s broader executive team, to perhaps folks on Dan’s team — everyone (except Jessie) played a non-trivial role in the debacle that was Zeus.

--

What might have prevented this debacle?

Several things actually:

1) Dan should not have been appointed as the leader for Zeus.

[[operators optimizing for optics - Operator|Operators]] are great for scaling, at the right time, but they often bring premature optimization to projects, and that can kill its prospects very early on. Even if most folks can’t see that readily, the project is dead before it was ever alive.

--

2) Things could have gone better even with Dan as leader. If Dan were more self-aware, he would have seen his role differently. 

He could have hired great [[operators optimizing for optics - Craftsperson|Craftspeople]] like Jessie on his team, and then *listened to those Craftspeople* to translate A&B’s vision to a winning product.

--

3) A&B (& the broader exec team) should have understood that a lot of what seemed like “great operations & management” actually hurts early-stage bold initiatives like Zeus.

Premature operational optimization can be a very bad thing for early-stage projects in startups & large companies.

--

4) Last, but by no means the least, A&B should have had the leadership maturity to see through (and candidly call out) what Dan was doing: managing for Optics, instead of 
a) actually understanding users
b) iterating towards differentiation
c) instilling a drive to win
d) optimizing for major business impact

--

This post is already quite long, so I will end it with an observation about this last point: 

Operators are everywhere in tech companies. 

They are extremely valuable. 

But, assigning an [[operators optimizing for optics - Operator|Operator]] who is not self-aware to the certain projects can be fatal for that project & your team.

--

You see, many Operators, even if they have good intentions, do not understand the role of a leader of an early stage initiative. 

Through years of experience with at-scale products & teams, and through years of sub-par training, they feel comfortable with “running the process”.

--

Operators like Dan legit think that their job is to understand what the CEO wants, orchestrate actions across the org based on that, and set up processes, structures & accountability checks to ensure that those actions are performed efficiently. 

What is their big miss here?

--

For any early stage product initiative, its leader ought to deeply understand the user & business problems to be solved, build a small, energetic team that is inspired to solve them, build product to test informed hypotheses, with the most basic process to support these actions.

--

Yes, it does matter what the Founder/CEO thinks. Yes, the Founder’s vision is to be understood & taken seriously. 

But every Founder worth their salt knows that real product work isn’t just about transcribing his/her vision. 

New product work is messy, and it requires enormous creativity.

--

What should Operators who want to get better at leading early stage products do?  

Chiefly, it requires unlearning some “truths” and playing with some new truths

So let me conclude this post with my prescription of what such Operators should do less of, and start doing more of:

|                           | do less of this                             | consider more of this                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| waht is my main job       | run the right process                       | solve the right user & business problem |
| early on in any project   | understand & set expectations               | understand & set goals                  |
| key goal of upward comms  | report progress                             | discuss learnings                       |
| pay greatest attention to | optics of execution                         | impact of execution                     |
| think like                | a senior leader at the company              | an owner of the company                 |
| primarily driven by       | incentives set by the company & its culture | internal ambition to achieve & improve  |
