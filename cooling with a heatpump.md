[[underfloor cooling]]

[[air to water heat pump]] (and other X to water heatpumps) can't just cool down because of condensation on the radiators. 

You either need 
- a smart system that manages [[dew point|dew temperature]] to prevent condensation
- handle condensation
	- fans to manage condensation on [[radiator|radiators]] 
	- a [[moisture barrier]] to protect the underfloor heating from condensation
