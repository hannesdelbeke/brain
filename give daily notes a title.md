My [[daily notes]] used to be named year-month-day, e.g. `2005-12-23`.
But when reading links to these [[note taking|notes]], it would just mention a date, showing no [[context]] to the reader.

Now I add the topic of the note for that day to the note title, instantly providing [[context]] on glance to every link.
e.g. `2005-12-23 promotion` or `2005-12-23 Fought a swan`

When there are multiple highlights on the same day, I create another note for the same date, and give it a different title. This encourages [[atomic]] notes, and maintains the on-glance context for all notes.
