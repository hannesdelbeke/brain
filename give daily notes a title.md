I used to just make daily notes like year-month-day :`2005-12-23`
But then when I opened a subject note, the backlinks section would just mention a date.

Now I add the topic of the day to the note title, instantly giving [[context]] in every link.
e.g. `2005-12-23 promotion` or `2005-12-23 Fought a swan`
If there are multiple highlights, I create a new note with todays date, and a different title. This encourages 1 note per concept / idea. Keeping my notes [[atomic]].
