**Idea**
Automatically show my driving ([[Tesla model 3]]) in my [[Google calendar]].

I did this already for [[2025-10 link Strava to Google calendar|showing Strava workouts in my Google calendar]].
Tesla is not very open with their API, but google tracks when you are driving, cycling, walking.
It would be fun and useful to [[visualize time spent]] in my calendar. Making it easier to review recent days.
