**pros**

	- has been around for years
	- maintained by a large company
	- no bugs losing data
**cons**
- [x] data lives in cloud only atm
- [x] google is known to [[sunset a project|sunset]] popular features
	- since this is used by lots of businesses it's unlikely to happen

## Next steps
If I want to continue to use [[Google Sheets]], I should consider
- [x] a regular automated [[backup]], or trust that google won't [[sunset a project|sunset]] sheets.
	- [x] ✅ [[Drive for desktop]] with `mirror mode` can do this.
	- [x] TODO setup on my [[personal pc]]
- [x] a way to incorporate [[public/link|linking]] files
	- ❌ TOO COMPLEX: Some kind of wrapper in obsidian for each gsheet file in drive, that forwards to the browser. The wrapper solution would add autocomplete. This overlaps with [[note linking duplicate source]]
		- use google api to access names of all my sheets
		- create google sheets/google drive obsidian plugin
		- add name of sheet to obsidian autocomplete
		- write feature to link to sheet when selected in autocomplete.
	- [ ] ✅ [[wikilink GDrive files]] by embedding the drive in my vault
