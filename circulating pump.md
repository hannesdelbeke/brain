A home water re-circulating pump is usedÂ **to circulate domestic hot water so that any faucet or shower will provide hot water instantly upon demand**. 

These systems slowly pump hot water through your hot water pipes and back to the water heater through either a dedicated line or through the cold water line.



## cons
- A recirculating pump can use more electricity than two refrigerators in a year if it's operated continuously. This is because the pump causes heat to dissipate in the pipes
- increased heat in the piping system, which in turn increases system [[pressure - physics|pressure]]. 
- Piping that is sensitive to the water condition (i.e., copper, and soft water) will be adversely affected by the continual flow
