backlinks let you go back to where you came from.
- better navigation 
- discovering related concepts leads to new ideas

Example
- A note about `William Tell` links to the `apple` note
```
William shot an arrow through an [[apple]] on his head.
```
- But the `apple` note does not mention `William Tell`
- A Backlink on the `apple` page would inform the viewer that another page talks about the current page. And enable easy navigation back to the previous page.
