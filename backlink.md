aliases:
  - backlinks

A backlink informs which notes [[link]] to the current note.

Backlinks easily let you go back to where you came from.
- better  [[navigation]] 
- better [[discovery]]: you discover related concepts that can lead to new ideas
## Examples
if note A links to note B.
note A has a link to note B
note B has a backlink to note A

This example shows how backlinks work in [[Obsidian]]:
- A note about `William Tell` links to the `apple` note
```
William shot an arrow through an [[apple]] on his head.
```
- But the `apple` note does not mention `William Tell`
- A backlink on the `apple` page would inform the viewer that another page talks about the current page. And enable easy navigation back to the previous page.
