the cons are minor, easy to live with them

cons
- doesn't start instantly (1-2 sec)
- no option to add nicknames to repo.
	- if i have a duplicate of a repo, with same name. it's hard to see the difference
	  e.g. same git repo, diff branch for review purpose
- no option to launch same project with different command line args
- only integrated with unity cloud, no git or perforce
- installing unity version sometimes fails download or install.
	- fails if administrator permission window pops up while AFK, and times out.
