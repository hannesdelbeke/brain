Longevity has 2 aspects
### Lifespan
- [[Lifespan]] is the **total number of years you live** 
- Often trying to prevent or slow down death from [[aging]]
### Health span
- The number of years you live **free from serious disease, disability, and cognitive decline**.
- It's about **quality of life**, not just length.

### Prioritize extending healthspan
- Many people live long lives but spend the last 10â€“20 years with **poor [[quality of life]]**.
- A longer lifespan without healthspan just **prolongs illness and frailty**.
## Notes
Aging is not accepted as a disease, so is not officially treated.
But everything that causes aging is seen as bad.
- people live over 100 years in [[blue zones]]
- take [[supplement]] if lacking certain nutritients
