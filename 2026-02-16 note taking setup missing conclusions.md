I asked [[OpenAI Codex]] to analyse my note on [[note taking]] and it's links/backlinks.

> read the note `c:\pkm\note taking` and all links & backlinks 1 level deep, and read those files for themes I may have missed about improving my setup.
  
## Core conclusions

1. Retrieval is the bottleneck, not capture volume.
	- Reusable notes matter more than writing many notes.
	- Unlinked/orphan notes become undiscoverable.
	- References: [[2025-11-27 my notes improved]], [[link unlinked notes]], [[unlinked notes]].

2. Simplicity beats structure-heavy systems in your case.
	- You repeatedly perform better with fewer folders and less meta-work.
	- References: [[reducing note folders]], [[minimal notetaking]], [[don't overthink note taking]], [[Intro to Obsidian]].

3. Link context is a core mechanism, not just style.
	- "Explain why you link" and descriptive titles make future retrieval dramatically better.
	- References: [[always explain why you link]], [[give daily notes a title]].

4. You need an explicit note lifecycle.
	- You already have multiple note types ([[journaling]]/scratch vs [[Evergreen notes|evergreen]]/reusable), but workflow rules are implicit.
	- References: [[the urge to write notes for everything]], [[Evergreen notes]], [[daily notes]], [[monthly review]].

5. Mobile capture friction is still unresolved.
	- This is a clear gap blocking consistent capture away from desk.
	- References: [[2025-10-21 write more on location]].

6. Backup and resilience are important but under-systematized.
	- Data-loss risk is recognized, but protective routines are not yet codified.
	- References: [[what if all data wiped in the world]], [[Intro to Obsidian]], [[2025-11-27 my notes improved]].

## More input

- Add one weekly maintenance note with 3 checks only:
	- unlinked notes review (link or archive)
	- promote 1 scratch/journal note into an evergreen note
	- backup health check
- Standardize capture classes in note frontmatter: `scratch`, `journal`, `evergreen`, `reference`.
- Keep your folder model minimal (`public` / `private`) and use links/overview notes for structure.
- Keep your "why linked" rule strict: no bare wikilinks in body text without one short reason phrase.
- For mobile, pick one low-friction fallback path first (phone quick-capture note), then optimize sync later.
