## cons
- requires you to edit your vault folder structure.
  files need to be moved to `repo-name/docs`
	- this could be a github action like in my template
## pros
this seems pretty good
- it has [[GitHub actions]] to automate the build
- supports [[MkDocs]] which is great

## tech
all the tech lives in this small file https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml
