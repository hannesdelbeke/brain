## Blender
- [[Blender]] has a [file browser](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/file_browser.html), which is basic and similar to the experience in explorer.
- Blender has an [asset browser](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/asset_browser.html), which is slow. It needs to load all the `.blend` files to generate the thumbnails. And it requires assets to be marked as an asset in the blend file.
