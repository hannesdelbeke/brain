I noticed I slept better after working on a laptop, because I could easily reduce screen brightness in the evening with 1 button. 

Now I use [[Monitorian]] on my pc for this. And it has improved my sleep.
- Even better: [[schedule Monitorian brightness]]

Of course the best thing is to not use your screen 2 hours before bed time at all. 
But I often do.

[[mobile phone|Phones]] have auto brightness, so automatically do this.
