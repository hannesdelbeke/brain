I can't 1 click install a Blender addon from a GitHub repo.

I can add the Github repo to the [[plugget]] packages repo, so we can 1-click install it from Plugget. but I have to 
- create a manifest
- test it to ensure no typos
- install through plugget

instead i want to just copy paste a URL, and click install
or even better, click a [[app URI]] to install the addon.

- [ ] TODO add option to plugget to take URLs as input, and attempt to auto generate a manifest

checkout [this addon](https://github.com/spectralvectors/GrabAddons) that aims to tackle the same issue
