> Always explain why you [[public/link]] a note, never just link a note.

I read this advice when learning [[personal knowledge management|PKM]], this turned out to be one of my most useful [[note taking]] habits. 
- It adds [[context]] to each link, which is especially useful when you revisit a note years later. I get the most value from my notes in the future, when I've forgotten all that context.
- It increases [[discovery]], you don't have to click & read each linked note to find the one you're looking for.

### Example
Don't just add a link
- www.example.com/23092342/doc44344-34r34-34.htm 
  *a complex URL can be unclear what it links, and why*
- blog [post](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2023/07/12/Design.html) 
  *Not a descriptive link, now I have to click the link to read what this is about*

Instead, add a human-readable description
- The documentation can be found [here](www.example.com/documentation)
- [documentation](www.example.com/documentation)
*Both examples clearly link to the documentation*

## Exceptions
#### Descriptive notes
If a [[wikilink]] has enough [[give daily notes a title|context in its title]], it might be sufficient to just link to that note. However, this context could be lost if the note is renamed.
#### Tags
The only time I suggest linking without context, is when using [[tag|tags]] & [[hashtag|hashtags]]. 
I started to use links instead of hashtags.
These often link notes by a concept without giving much context.
I find it helpful to try to minimize those low context links, and try to always put them in the same location of my notes, e.g. at the bottom of the note.
