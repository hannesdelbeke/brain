# compare with parsec
Moonlight/Sunshine is better for gaming, since video quality is miles ahead of anything else due to Nvidia's encoder. Input latency overall also seems better from my experience.

However, it does work a bit worse when on desktop due to mouse latency. On that aspect, [[Parsec]] works better and is also better for when you're not connected to the same network of your PC, as it's what it was designed for. Sunshine also works but requires some more effort to set up, and is overall less immediate.
