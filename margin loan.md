a [[loan]] against your [[equity]]
similar to how a mortgage is a loan against your house
interest changes time to time

you can take out a margin loan against your portfolio, and buy a house
if you can't pay it back you loose your portfolio but not the house.

> [!brain fart example]
> - 600k stocks, borrow 300k on margin (LTV 50)
> - move the debt from the margin loan to a mortgage
> 	- buy cash house, get unencumbered mortgage with bank against house to release e.g. 70% cash.
> 	- put back in stocks, now margin loan is more stable
> - how is this different from just putting 300k back in stocks?
> 	  900k stock, 300 margin -> LTV 30
> 	  there must be something that prevents you from increasing margin again.
