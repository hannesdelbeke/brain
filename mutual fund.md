**Mutual funds** are typically bought and sold only once per day, after the market closes, at the **net asset value (NAV)** calculated at that time. If you place an order before the fund's specific cut-off time (often 4 p.m. ET in the US, or earlier in the UK), you get that day's closing price. Orders placed after the cut-off receive the next business day's price.
