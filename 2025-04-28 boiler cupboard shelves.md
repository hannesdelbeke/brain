i made 2 shelves for the boiler cupboard.

i cut them too short by about .5 cm
sadly i cut both of them, before measuring.

i still sanded & painted them with 2 layers afterwards, it looks poorly done.
- didn't sand enough, paint gave off a bit in some spots
- cut is not perfectly straight (but acceptable)
- needs more layers of paint. Can see the original coat in some spots.
- got paint on the grass in my [[garden]]
- I got grass & dirt on the shelves. I rushed too much, and wasn't experienced enough

next time?
- ensure i cut correct with circle saw.
- fit after cutting the first one.
- maybe not bother painting, or spend more time & care painting.
- paint over a tarp
- sand more, or with coarser grade

can it be saved?
- with a thicker shelf holder maybe. like those metal clips

### a month later
I barely used the shelves. not using this cupboard
i thought i d save tools in there, it'd help so much with organizing. but it didn't, because thecupboard is hard to access with the door blocking it.
