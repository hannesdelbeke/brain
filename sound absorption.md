- **Open structure is essential**: Materials like rockwool, fiberglass, and acoustic foam absorb sound by allowing air to enter their pores. The sound energy is dissipated as heat through friction and viscous losses.
- **Density matters—but not linearly**:
    - _Too low_: Air passes through without much resistance → poor absorption.
    - _Too high_: Air can't penetrate → reflects sound instead of absorbing.
    - _Optimal range_: Depends on frequency. Lower frequencies need thicker and denser materials; higher frequencies are absorbed by lighter, more porous ones.
- **Airflow resistivity**: This is the real MVP. It measures how much the material resists air movement. Ideal absorbers have moderate-to-high airflow resistivity, which correlates with effective sound damping
