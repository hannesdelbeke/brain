a big project for only a few new features
currently not worth my time

the new features:
- give projects a nickname, so you can have 2 branches checked out of the same project without confusion
- When trying to open a project, that's already open, make that project's window active.
  Instead of just saying "this project is already open"
- support other [[version control]], not just Unity Version control

existing features
- project name
- project path + browse to
- set unity version
- download unity apps/versions

[[tool idea]]
