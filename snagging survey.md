A snagging survey is a house survey that ensures the fixtures and fittings are up to standards on a new build.

In the UK, you have a two-year period after completion to report any snags in a new-build home, and the developer is legally obliged to fix them. (according to the [New Homes Quality Code](https://newhomesinspectionsuk.com/snagging-survey-guide/) and warranties like the NHBC warranty.)
While you can submit a list of issues within this time, the best practice is to have a professional snagging survey done before you move in, ideally before exchanging contracts. This helps ensure defects are attributed to poor workmanship rather than damage from living in the property. 

Many newbuild warranties include a 2 year builder's warranty

It's like [[validation]] for your new build house.

Usually done after purchase in the UK, unless access can be arranged before with the developer.
