often there already is a tool that does what you want
but people want to use their favorite tool for everything, even when it doesn't work that well and there's a lot of friction.

e.g. If you want to use [[visual studio code|vscode]] for everything, including editing [[xlsx]] files.
But [[Google Sheets]] is better at editing [[xlsx]] files.
