## I love Pyblish
I have a love hate relation with [[Pyblish]]. I've learned a lot working with it. Gave back several contributions to the various projects, and actively contributed to the forum.
The longer I worked with it, the more I found myself reaching the limits, and feeling limited in attempts to fix and expand it.
I created a long-term plan to improve Pyblish on the [forum](https://forums.pyblish.com/t/long-term-goal/681/3?u=hannes)

Pros
- easy to pick up and get started
- tested in several dcc-s
- ships with UI
- working with Marcus can be educational.
- modular plugin infrastructure & discovery & plugin registration
- support for actions
- plugin dependency management
