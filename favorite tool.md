Favorite your scenes in [[Blender]]
- user picks any blend file
- creates button to import it

User makes any button to do whatever:
- similar to toolbar
- similar to [[my app launcher]]

**stage 1 MVP**
hardcode paths, import blend file only (link vs unlink)
or open blend file

**stage 2**
more generic, not just import blends
also import GLB, FBX, …
any ACTION can be run, when click the BUTTON

**stage 3**
make it dcc agnostic
this would work in [[Autodesk Maya|maya]], [[Unreal]], [[Blender]], …
this means
- generic file input selection
- dcc agnostic action, that can be adjusted per dcc

This is a good use case for [[buttonizer]]
using commands you can make your own [[file browser]], if the commands are searchable
