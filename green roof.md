## green roof
3 options
- soil is heavy, A sedum roof however, made with sedum matting, is reasonably light weight
- consider 1 or 2 planters on the side, to keep weight low. instead of planters everywhere
- create a very sturdy bin roof. that can support lots of soil.

Sedum doesn't enjoy shade. if i plant a tree that might be an issue.

bluum recommends:
- sedum
- succulents [kit](https://southwoldsucculentco.co.uk/shop-for-plants/ols/products/hardy-succulent-hanging-basket-kit-with-hanger)
	- Never, ever use multi-purpose compost. John Innes no 3 is ideal , but no 2 will suffice.
	- Mix a free draining element into your soil before planting. This can be horticultural grit, gravel or perlite.
	- Increase the ratio of  the perlite/grit/gravel if your area has a wetter climate. Up to 80% drainage
- alpine plants
- wildflowers
- grasses
