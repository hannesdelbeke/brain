NuGetForUnity is a [[NuGet]] client to run inside [[Unity]].

🔹 **What it is:**
- A NuGet client for Unity that allows you to install and manage C# libraries from the NuGet ecosystem.
- ==Primarily used for adding .NET libraries== that aren’t already available in Unity’s built-in package manager.

🔹 **Pros:**  
✅ Access to a massive library of .NET packages, including JSON.NET, Google.Protobuf, and System.Reactive.  
✅ Simple installation and integration for non-Unity-specific dependencies.  
✅ Works well for backend-heavy Unity projects.

🔹 **Cons:**  
❌ Many NuGet packages aren’t designed with Unity in mind (e.g., they might target .NET 5+ or depend on unavailable assemblies).  
❌ Compatibility issues—some packages may require manual fixes due to Unity's .NET Standard limitations.  
❌ Not tightly integrated with Unity's package system (no UPM compatibility).
