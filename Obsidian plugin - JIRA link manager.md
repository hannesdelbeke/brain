JIRA link manager
link with a [[wikilink]] with to JIRA IDs, like the ticket ID `[[AB12345]]`. 

Pros
- Looks neat in our Obsidian notes, 
Cons
- if you swap to another project, e.g. by joining another company, the ticket ID might not be unique between these projects. So it only works within your "environment".
