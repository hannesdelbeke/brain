Often, problems are already optimally solved by millions of years of evolution.
Some examples below:
### Optimal caching prediction
In computer caching prediction, the most optimal solution is using the most recent used data. The human brain follows a similar concept for memory usage. 
See [[Algorithms to Live By]] &  [[Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve]]
### Optimal distribution network
Scientists found that slime mold grew in the same patterns as the Tokyo metro, if they placed food sources on a map, at the locations of the metro stops.
The mushroom then created the most optimal pattern to distribute nutrients.
