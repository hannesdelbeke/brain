Quick overview - Atlas is a real-time multiplayer PvE raiding game on mobile, where you can play with anything from (still TBC) 6 to 40 other players. The focus is on fulfilling specific team roles, rather than just everyone piling on damage. It uses a fixed camera perspective, similar to [[Diablo]].

The main challenge right now are around making the combat and raid experience feel right, and I've been spending a lot of time with the game design team prototyping and experimenting with combat ideas.

The art side had a late start, they are still concepting a lot, so there hasn't been a huge amount there... yet! The main challenges I see will be around optimisation and visual noise. There is going to be a lot of characters on screen with VFX and UI triggering all the time, so making it look good yet readable is hard. This in turn means rendering optimisation is going to vital to make it run well on phone.

For content, the level baking/building is going to be a challenge - it's very dependent on the design requirements and there could be quite a few raids, so hand building every level isn't likely going to be viable.
