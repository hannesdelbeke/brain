- [[acoustic wall panel]] 
- accoustic ceiling panel
- foam panels 
- create a room in a room, touching each other as little as possible to prevent low frequencies propagating [note](https://anthonyamar.fr/Acoustic/Soundproofing)

| absorb sound      | reflect sound    |     |     |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --- | --- |
| lower densities   | higher densities |     |     |
| thicker materials |                  |     |     |

you can perforate hard materials to make them more absorbant
this [site](https://www.payette.com/research-innovation/the-geometry-of-sound-diffusion/) has cool gifs on sound wave research, and found that the best shape is that of a standard accoustic panel. A row of triangles on a square. each square is rotated 90 degrees.
