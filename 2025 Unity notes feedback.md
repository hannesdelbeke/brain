feedback on my forumpost: [[link Unity to Obsidian]] and [[link Obsidian to Unity]]
source: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-unity-bi-directional-links/98835/3
### The feedback
I think the linking between unity and obsidian via deep links is a fantastic start. But, the note-system seems a bit clunky and feel like an interruption to the flow we have gotten spoiled by within Obsidian (especially the way you have to manually type the deep link in code). Unity-users would likely be more attracted to using a more mature note-taking workflows via Unity assets, or even custom solutions.

For example, I currently use:

[[DevTasks]] by Tiny Giant Studio

[[Task Atlas]] by Shrinkray Entertainment

These are more elegant and interactive in terms of tracking tasks and taking notes on Unity's side. I think it would be wise to find out how this flow you have discovered can integrate into mature note-taking assets on the Unity-side! In the end, its all just text (store in some fancy scriptable object usually, but still just text), so I have a feeling this can be done!

As I try this out, I am going to investigate how this might be integrated into those kinds of already existing workflows. Obsidian is a gorgeous note-taking medium. To truly make a Unity-integration feel natural, we have to make sure the note-taking process on Unity’s side feels at least of somewhat equivalent quality, and does interrupt the flow.

### Notes

[[Game dev flow]]
[[2026-02-16 Game dev flow typed link contract v1]]


[[DevTasks]]
it moves info into the unity project, completely integrating it with the editor.
Instead of my solution, where it links to an external Obsidian vault.

I like that they visualize sticky notes in [[Task Atlas]] in editor in the 3d game world
