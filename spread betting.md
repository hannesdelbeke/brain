when spread betting, you bet an amount of money per point on whether a market will go up or down. 
For instance, you might bet £5 per point that the price of the FTSE 100 will fall. 

With CFDs you buy and sell contracts that represent a specified amount in the underlying market.
For example one standard FTSE contract might be worth £10 per point.
### capital gains tax
Spread betting profits are free from capital gains tax, 
CFDs are liable because they are a financial instrument. 

This may seem a major drawback, but any losses can be offset against future profits for tax purposes, which makes CFDs good for **hedging** (see below).

**stamp duty** on share trades doesn't apply to either spread betting or CFDs, as you never own the underlying shares in either case.

## usage
- Go long or short
- Trade using leverage (ie trade on margin)
- Access some markets 24 hours a day

> [!WARNING]
> Leverage means leveraged losses.
> x 2 seem relatively stable on SNP long tern, but x 3 can wipe out

other option is x3 ETF
