I use [[2025 - Instagram as a diary|Instagram as a diary]], so my data is in [[the cloud]] and not [[backup|backed up]].

todo back this up
1. it'd be great to have at least a simple backup
2. a more custom solution. where i can create my own memories also from google photo etc, and notes, and [[public/link]] them.
this could be for starters in [[Obsidian]], but ideally stores the images locally somehow, so they load foast, and we don't rely on [[google photos]]

end result
- i want a view of memories, in a grid for quick overview.
- each memory can have an image attached, but it's not required

it's basically a database with [[thumbnail]]s
