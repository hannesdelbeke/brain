Errant Worlds is a set of Unreal Engine plugins that leverage procedural generation in order to facilitate creation of large and beautiful worlds.

## Biomes
Procedural placement of foliage and gameplay elements

Our Biomes plugin allows you to place naturally looking vegetation on your map. You do it by defining biomes, sub-biomes and species. 
- A biome: the region’s climate, e.g. desert, temperate, humid, arctic. 
- A sub-biome: the environment characteristic to that biome, e.g. rainforest, field, grassland, desert, ice. 
- Each sub-biome contains a list of species which occur in its area, and species contain logic describing where they grow. Some species may only grow at high altitude, on eastern slopes of sunny hills ...
## Landscape
Easy terrain shaping and landscape manipulation.

Height stamps for terrain
