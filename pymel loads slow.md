both sugestions made no time diff for me in maya

The bulk of the work is happening when [[PyMel]] is initializing a bunch of [[Maya MEL|mel]] scripts.  
Skip by setting the `PYMEL_SKIP_MEL_INIT` environment variable to any value.

To skip initializing plugins, you can set `skip_initial_plugins=true` in the `pymel.conf` file
## pymel core
when importing `pymel.core as pm` for the first time, it freezes maya for a few seconds

it takes a while to load, because it scans all the loaded plugins, and then wraps any provided commands with a PyMel version.

workaround
- The best way to speed that process up would be to unload any plugins you’re not actually making use of.
## pymel all
`import pymel.all` operation instead of just an `import pymel.core` can be substantially longer. As it is generating all the various Node classes upfront.

- `compile`: Takes up over **1 second**—a sign that lots of Python files are being parsed and converted to bytecode on the fly.
- `_installCallbacks` and `_pluginLoaded`: Nearly **a full second** between them—this is likely PyMEL wiring itself into Maya’s plugin and event system.
- `loadApiCache` via `factories.py`: Roughly **half a second**—this loads cached bindings and type data, which can be optimized.

If you're looking to shave this down, a few possible directions:

1. **Set `PYMEL_SKIP_MEL_INIT=1`** before import (as you’ve started to explore). It skips some MEL-based bootstrapping.
2. **Precompile your `.py` files to `.pyc`**, especially in PyMEL’s site-packages path, to avoid repeated compilation.
3. **Profile deeper with call graphs**: Tools like [](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot)or [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) can turn `cProfile` dumps into flame graphs that show what _calls_ what—and how deeply.

If you want, I can help you:

- Dump this to a `.prof` file
- Visualize the full call stack
- Patch PyMEL’s import to isolate just the expensive bits
