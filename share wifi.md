When you set up a new [[Windows]] pc and have to enter the wifi, it often takes a long time typing the password.
Even if I have the password on my phone, there's no easy way to transfer it over.
	e.g. [[Quick Share]] only works once you are already connected to the wifi

when setting up my Samsung tablet, there was an option to scan a QR code from my phone.
Which then auto set up the [[WiFi]] on the tablet, and set up my google accounts from my phone on the laptop.
