## Chase money & a structured routine
Most people without children work a desk job, and take a few weeks of [[holiday]] a year. e.g. a trip to Europe, and 2 weeks international trip, + some weekends away.
They build up pension, buy a nice house, etc. But don't always feel fulfilled. 

## Chase your passion
[[influencer|Influencers]], ski instructors, hiking guides, [[yoga teacher|yoga teachers]], ... are outdoors all the time, teaching others. It seems they have fun all the time.
Or do they get bored? Always showing the same climbing routes, pretending to be excited and happy, keeping up with social media posts ... 
- Similar challenges to [[teaching]].
- Being a [[digital nomad]] can be lonely.
- If you love your [[passion]], this seems like the dream.
