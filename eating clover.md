Clover is edible, but not a choice food.
It has a lot of protein and vitamines. But doesn't taste great to most people.

- **Young leaves and flowers** are sometimes used in teas or salads.
- **Moderation is key**: occasional foraging is fine, but it’s not a staple food.
- **Avoid during bloom-heavy or wet seasons**, when toxin levels may spike.

☠️ Toxic Compounds in Clover
- **Phytoestrogens**: Red clover is rich in isoflavones, which mimic estrogen. In large or prolonged doses, these can disrupt hormone balance in both animals and humans, potentially affecting fertility.
- **Cyanogenic Glycosides**: White clover can produce **hydrogen cyanide** when its tissues are damaged—a defense mechanism known as **cyanogenesis**. This can be toxic if consumed in large quantities or under stress conditions like drought.
