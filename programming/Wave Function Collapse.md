*example of a 2D implementation*

The Wave Function Collapse is an algorithm similar to sudoku, can be used in 2D & 3D.
- Decide all the possible states from an adjacent cell
- If only 1 state is possible, fill in that state.
- For remaining cells with multiple possible states (superpositions), 
	- either manually pick a state
	- or auto-fill by randomly picking a state.
