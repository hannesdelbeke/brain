a fucntional approach to MVP
```python
import sys
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QLabel, QLineEdit, QVBoxLayout, QWidget


def create_person_view():
    name_label = QLabel("Name:")
    name_input = QLineEdit()

    age_label = QLabel("Age:")
    age_input = QLineEdit()

    layout = QVBoxLayout()
    layout.addWidget(name_label)
    layout.addWidget(name_input)
    layout.addWidget(age_label)
    layout.addWidget(age_input)

    widget = QWidget()
    widget.setLayout(layout)
    return widget


def update_name(name, name_input):
    name_input.setText(name)


def update_age(age, age_input):
    age_input.setText(age)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)

    person_model = {
        'name': '',
        'age': ''
    }

    main_window = QMainWindow()
    main_window.setCentralWidget(create_person_view())

    name_input = main_window.centralWidget().findChild(QLineEdit, 'name_input')
    age_input = main_window.centralWidget().findChild(QLineEdit, 'age_input')

    name_input.textChanged.connect(lambda: update_name(name_input.text(), name_input))
    age_input.textChanged.connect(lambda: update_age(age_input.text(), age_input))

    main_window.show()

    sys.exit(app.exec_())

```

In this example, the `create_person_view` function is responsible for creating and configuring the View. It returns a QWidget object representing the View.

The `update_name` and `update_age` functions are responsible for updating the View based on changes in the Model. They receive the relevant data from the Model and update the corresponding dictionary (`person_model`) containing the data properties.

Advantages of using a function-based approach in MVP:

1. Simplicity: Functions offer a simpler and more straightforward implementation compared to classes. They can be easier to understand and modify.
    
2. Separation of Concerns: Functions allow for a clear separation of responsibilities. The View creation is handled by one function, while the update functions handle the data synchronization between the Model and the View.
    
3. Flexibility: Functions can be more flexible in terms of composition and reusability. They can be easily combined and composed to create complex interactions between the Model and the View.

However, it's important to note that the choice between class-based or function-based implementation in MVP depends on the specific requirements and complexity of the application. Both approaches have their own benefits and trade-offs, and the choice should be based on what works best for the specific context and development team.
