# Amazon Sumerian
Amazon Sumerian lets you create and run virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D
applications quickly and easily without requiring any specialized programming or 3D graphics expertise.
With Sumerian, you can build highly immersive and interactive scenes that run on popular hardware
such as Oculus Go, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, Google Daydream, and Lenovo Mirage as well
as Android and iOS mobile devices. For example, you can build a virtual classroom that lets you train
new employees around the world, or you can build a virtual environment that enables people to tour
a building remotely. Sumerian makes it easy to create all the building blocks needed to build highly
immersive and interactive 3D experiences including adding objects (e.g. characters, furniture, and
landscape), and designing, animating, and scripting environments. Sumerian does not require specialized
expertise and you can design scenes directly from your browser.
