# AWS Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services
developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as
Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and Internet Information Services (IIS).
You can simply upload your code, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment,
from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring. At the
same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the
underlying resources at any time.
