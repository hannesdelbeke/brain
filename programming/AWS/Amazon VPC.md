# Amazon VPC
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS
Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete
control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range,
creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and
IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications.
You can easily customize the network configuration for your VPC. For example, you can create a publicfacing subnet for your web servers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems, such
as databases or application servers, in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage
multiple layers of security (including security groups and network access control lists) to help control
access to EC2 instances in each subnet.
Additionally, you can create a hardware virtual private network (VPN) connection between your
corporate data center and your VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate data
center.
