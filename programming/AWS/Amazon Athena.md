# Amazon Athena
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using
standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the
queries that you run.
Athena is easy to use. Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying
using standard SQL. Most results are delivered within seconds. With Athena, thereâ€™s no need for complex
extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs to prepare your data for analysis. This makes it easy for anyone
with SQL skills to quickly analyze large-scale datasets.
Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified
metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate your
Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema versioning.
