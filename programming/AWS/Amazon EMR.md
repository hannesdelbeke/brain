# Amazon EMR
Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data
using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi,
and Presto. Amazon EMR makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale your big data environments by
automating time-consuming tasks like provisioning capacity and tuning clusters. With EMR you can
run petabyte-scale analysis at less than half of the cost of traditional on-premises solutions andover 3x
faster than standard Apache Spark. You can run workloads on Amazon EC2 instances, on Amazon Elastic
Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters, or on-premises using EMR on AWS Outposts.
