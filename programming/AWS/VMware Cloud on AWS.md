Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) bare metal infrastructure. VMware Cloud on AWS is

VMware Cloud on AWS brings the broad, diverse and rich innovations of AWS services natively to the
enterprise applications running on VMware's compute, storage and network virtualization platforms.
This allows organizations to easily and rapidly add new innovations to their enterprise applications by
natively integrating AWS infrastructure and platform capabilities such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple
Queue Service (SQS), Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon
Kinesis, and Amazon Redshift, among many others.
With VMware Cloud on AWS, organizations can simplify their Hybrid IT operations by using the same
VMware Cloud Foundation technologies including vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and vCenter Server across
their on-premises data centers and on the AWS Cloud without having to purchase any new or custom
hardware, rewrite applications, or modify their operating models. The service automatically provisions
infrastructure and provides full VM compatibility and workload portability between your on-premises
environments and the AWS Cloud. With VMware Cloud on AWS, you can leverage AWS's breadth of
services, including compute, databases, analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), security, mobile, deployment,
application services, and more.
