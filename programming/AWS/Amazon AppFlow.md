# Amazon AppFlow
Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data
between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Zendesk, Slack, and ServiceNow, and
AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, in just a few clicks. With Amazon AppFlow, you can
run data flows at enterprise scale at the frequency you choose - on a schedule, in response to a business
event, or on demand. You can configure data transformation capabilities like filtering and validation to
generate rich, ready-to-use data as part of the flow itself, without additional steps. Amazon AppFlow
automatically encrypts data in motion, and allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public
Internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security
threats.
