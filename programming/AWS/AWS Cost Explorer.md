# AWS Cost Explorer
AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your
AWS costs and usage over time. Get started quickly by creating custom reports (including charts and
tabular data) that analyze cost and usage data, both at a high level (e.g., total costs and usage across
all accounts) and for highly-specific requests (e.g., m2.2xlarge costs within account Y that are tagged
“project: secretProject”).
