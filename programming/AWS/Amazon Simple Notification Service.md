# Amazon Simple Notification Service
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed
pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and
serverless applications. Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many
messaging. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan out messages to a large number of
subscriber endpoints for parallel processing, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and
HTTP/S webhooks. Additionally, SNS can be used to fan out notifications to end users using mobile push,
SMS, and email.
