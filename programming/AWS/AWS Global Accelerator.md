# AWS Global Accelerator
AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of the
applications that you offer to your global users.
Today, if you deliver applications to your global users over the public internet, your users might face
inconsistent availability and performance as they traverse through multiple public networks to reach
your application. These public networks are often congested and each hop can introduce availability
and performance risk. AWS Global Accelerator uses the highly available and congestion-free AWS global
network to direct internet traffic from your users to your applications on AWS, making your usersâ€™
experience more consistent.
To improve the availability of your application, you must monitor the health of your application
endpoints and route traffic only to healthy endpoints. AWS Global Accelerator improves application availability by continuously monitoring the health of your application endpoints and routing traffic to
the closest healthy endpoints.
AWS Global Accelerator also makes it easier to manage your global applications by providing static
IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application hosted on AWS which eliminates the
complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS
Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure and manage.
