## AWS Serverless Application Repository
The AWS Serverless Application Repository enables you to quickly deploy code samples, components, and complete applications for common use cases such as web and mobile back-ends, event and data processing, logging, monitoring, IoT, and more. Each application is packaged with an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template that defines the AWS resources used. Publicly shared applications also include a link to the applicationâ€™s source code. There is no additional charge to use the Serverless Application Repository - you only pay for the AWS resources used in the applications you deploy.

You can also use the Serverless Application Repository to publish your own applications and share them within your team, across your organization, or with the community at large. To share an application you've built, publish it to the AWS Serverless Application Repository.
