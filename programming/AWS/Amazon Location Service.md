# Amazon Location Service
Amazon Location Service makes it easy for developers to add location functionality to applications
without compromising data security and user privacy.
Location data is a vital ingredient in todayâ€™s applications, enabling capabilities ranging from asset
tracking to location-based marketing. However, developers face significant barriers when integrating
location functionality into their applications. This includes cost, privacy and security compromises, and
tedious and slow integration work.
Amazon Location Service provides affordable data, tracking and geofencing capabilities, and native
integrations with AWS services, so you can create sophisticated location-enabled applications quickly,
without the high cost of custom development. You retain control of your location data with Amazon
Location, and you can combine proprietary data with data from the service. Amazon Location provides
cost-effective location-based services (LBS) using high-quality data from global, trusted providers Esri
and HERE.
