# Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data,
videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a
developer-friendly environment. CloudFront is integrated with AWS – both physical locations that are
directly connected to the AWS global infrastructure, as well as other AWS services. CloudFront works
seamlessly with services including AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing or
Amazon EC2 as origins for your applications, and Lambda@Edge to run custom code closer to customers’
users and to customize the user experience.
You can get started with the Content Delivery Network in minutes, using the same AWS tools that you're
already familiar with: APIs, AWS Management Console, AWS CloudFormation, CLIs, and SDKs. Amazon's
CDN offers a simple, pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront fees or required long-term contracts,
and support for the CDN is included in your existing AWS Support subscription.
