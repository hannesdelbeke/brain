# AWS Step Functions
AWS Step Functions is a fully managed service that makes it easy to coordinate the components of
distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications from individual
components that each perform a discrete function lets you scale easily and change applications quickly.
Step Functions is a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your
application. Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the components of
your application as a series of steps. This makes it simple to build and run multi-step applications.
Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your
application runs in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things do
go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly. You can change and add steps without even
writing code, so you can easily evolve your application and innovate faster.
