# Amazon API Gateway
https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 

With a few clicks in the [[AWS Management Console]], you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on [[Amazon EC2]], code running on [[AWS Lambda]], or any web application. 

Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management,
authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.
