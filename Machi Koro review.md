A fun & simple family game, that's more interactive than [[Carcassonne]] 

### Pro
- easy to pick up for new players
- nice art
- I like the early 1 dice gameplay. & tactical change of e.g. wheat fields during 2 die gameplay
- Blue cards (gain money when anyone rolls X) improve interaction when it's not your turn.
- turns don't take too long, so players don't sit around bored.
### Con
- can take long with 4 players
- simple so not that much replay-ability
- frustrating if you never roll what you need
- game ends just when your engine starts to feel good

### Card types
Red cards: steal from others
Blue cards: get money when everyone rolls X
Green cards: get more money, but only on your turn
Purple cards: special cards
