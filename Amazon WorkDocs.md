# Amazon WorkDocs
Amazon WorkDocs is a fully managed, secure enterprise storage and sharing service with strong
administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve user productivity.
Users can comment on files, send them to others for feedback, and upload new versions without having
to resort to emailing multiple versions of their files as attachments. Users can take advantage of these
capabilities wherever they are, using the device of their choice, including PCs, Macs, tablets, and phones.
Amazon WorkDocs offers IT administrators the option of integrating with existing corporate directories,
flexible sharing policies and control of the location where data is stored. You can get started using
Amazon WorkDocs with a 30-day free trial providing 1 TB of storage per user for up to 50 users.
