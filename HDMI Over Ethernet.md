- HDMI Extender Over CAT6/7 Cables ([[hardware]])
	- extenders have different resolutions. 4K vs 8K
	- extenders have different distances

A 1080P video signal requires a bandwidth of around 6 Gbps, while a 4K video signal requires a bandwidth of around 18 Gbps. To ensure reliable transmission of the HDMI signal, it is recommended to use a gigabit Ethernet network or higher. 
- [ ] this seems too high
- [ ] From this data it seems [[Powerline Ethernet Adapter]] is too slow to stream HDMI.

[[HDMI KVM over IP]] is quite similar but  is not limited to Ethernet and supports input like controller, mouse & keyboard.
