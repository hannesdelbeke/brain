## DHW heat pumps

DHW heat pumps, or domestic hot water heat pumps, use the thermal energy already present in the environment to generate domestic hot water. They are also suitable for optimal consumption of self-generated power from photovoltaic systems and can be coupled to an existing air distribution system.

### Structure and operating principle of the DHW heat pump

A DHW heat pump consists of a unit containing all the important components for the heat recovery process. These include the evaporator, the compressor, the condenser and the DHW cylinder. Depending on the version, an additional solar heat exchanger will be integrated, which enables the connection of solar collectors.
