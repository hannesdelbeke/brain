People have opinions on what should be on the single [[toolbar|shelve]] shared with everyone.
E.g. By default in Unreal you only have a single shelve [[Unreal toolbar]], not multiple like with [[Maya shelf|Maya shelves]].

I don't want to see other teams tools on my shelf. That's silly!
Now it will take more [[cognitive load]] for me to find my own tools, since my brain unconsciously compares everything that I see when i search for something.  


Unreal's UI is already overwhelming enough, let's not force more visual noise on people.
