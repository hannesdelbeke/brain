A multi-split heat pump system consists of one outdoor unit serving two or more indoor units (up to 6). 

Multi-split systems are [[ductless]] systems, (some indoor units can use short ductwork to serve a small space)

the system cannot handle use cases that require both heating and cooling simultaneously. (Unlike conventional systems or a [[variable refrigerant flow heat pump|VRF heat pump]] system with heat recovery)
