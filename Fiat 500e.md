rented one for lake district trip

pros
- great driving and auto assist.
- feels sporty

cons
- slower accelerate
- short range, charging it often was expensive and slow, once struggled to get to charger
- small, not much space in backseats. small boot
- louder inside than [[Tesla]], quieter than a [[internal combustion engines|ICE]]

Biggest con was how often i had to charge, and charge was slow.

driving in the UK took some getting used too.
Those national speed limit signs are weird.
- **Motorways and dual carriageways**: 70 mph
- **Single carriageways**: 60 mph
- **Built-up areas**: 30 mph
blue sign with red cross is no stopping sign
