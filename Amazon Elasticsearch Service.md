# Amazon Elasticsearch Service
Amazon Elasticsearch Service makes it easy to deploy, secure, operate, and scale Elasticsearch to search,
analyze, and visualize data in real-time. With Amazon Elasticsearch Service, you get easy-to-use APIs
and real-time analytics capabilities to power use-cases such as log analytics, full-text search, application
monitoring, and clickstream analytics, with enterprise-grade availability, scalability, and security. The
service offers integrations with open-source tools like Kibana and Logstash for data ingestion and
visualization. It also integrates seamlessly with other AWS services such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
(Amazon VPC), AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda,
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Cognito, and Amazon CloudWatch, so that you can
go from raw data to actionable insights quickly.
