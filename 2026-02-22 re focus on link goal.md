Let's zoom out. I can tell I'm loosing focus, since I'm writing[[2026-02-22 strava link with note as middleman| a Strava link note]], but I don't care much about Strava.

### Observation

I wrote a lot about [[note taking]]. Ensure I don't go too meta, and waste time [[writing notes about notes]]. 

### Goal

To create a better [[Flow]] for [[note taking]]. ⚠️**This is still meta**⚠️

To explore the idea of [[Turning Obsidian into a data lake]] / How can I [[use more links in life]]. I discovered the power of links: the smooth [[flow]], the ultimate navigation, going back and forth between files, between sites visited, etc. , and I want this power everywhere.

### Why do I write? 

Good reasons
- To **define a problem** better, and be able to think more high level, hoping for new insight. Clearly defining a concept creates an [[abstraction]] that helps me overcome my [[limited brain working memory]].
- To [[brainstorm]]: exploring new ideas.

Meh reasons
- [[emotional|Feelings]]: Because I enjoy it, and it feels like I'm productive.
- [[Writing]] notes about note taking is easy, because I'm doing it, so I can document what works and what doesn't.

## Outcome
I'm still not sure on what the [[use more links in life]] looks like. 
I tried to write examples like [[2026-02-22 strava link with note as middleman]], but it doesn't resonate.

> [!success]
> The one that resonated was: click a contact in a note, and then link to their Instagram, or their location in home assistant, or their current steam game.
> Create [[flow]].
> Create [[relationship|relationships]]

[[TODO link contacts to photos and memories]]
