When updating a code project, I try to write a note to my future self about what I did, and why, capturing the [[context]] of the moment. 
Then in the future, when I forget why I did something, and perhaps consider undoing it, I can reference my notes to help my decisions.

But this is basically the same as 
- a git commit description - (if I paid attention to this)
- release notes - (if I bothered writing one)

- [ ] Perhaps I can sync my release notes to my Obsidian vault? [[glue code]]
- [ ] can we support bidirectional editing?

Release logs from PRs i my GitHub projects, are basically notes summarizing a change in the project.
