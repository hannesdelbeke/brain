TLDR:
Avoid fancy complex task tracking systems.
Instead, use simple lists that you regularly triage with ruthless deletion of irrelevant tasks. Any task pushed to later must have a specific date.

## The "Fish" Metaphor
Rands argues that people treat productivity systems like fish: they keep insisting you "just haven't had the right kind." In reality, systems fail because they demand constant maintenance that eventually becomes unsustainable.

## The Tool Rule
**"If the work to maintain a tool is greater than the perceived value it creates, I will stop using it."**
- **Maintenance Bloat:** Tags, buckets, and sub-tasks feel like work but are actually "fake productivity."
- **The Failure State:** Systems die when lists grow so long that "signal" is lost in the "noise."

## The "Hostile" Approach
Rands suggests a system should be "hostile" to prevent task hoarding:
- **The 30-Day Auto-Delete:** If a task has no due date and no updates for 30 days, it should be deleted.
- **Time as a Filter:** Most things that seem "[[urgent]]" when requested by others are objectively irrelevant a week later.

## The Three-Action Framework
Borrowing from his success with [[Inbox Zero]], Rands applies three binary choices to every task and [[email]]:

1. **Delete/Unsubscribe:** Aggressively remove noise immediately.
2. **Respond/Commit:** If it’s actionable, do it now or commit to doing it *today*. *Similar to [[One‑Touch Rule]]*
3. **Later:** Punt to a specific future date or the "Someday" bucket. 
    - *Warning:* "Later" compounds. Too many "Laters" create a management mountain. [[backlog]]

## Key Habits for Stamina
- **Morning Triage:** Spend max 5 minutes every morning touching every task.
- **Rewriting:** If a task is stuck, rewrite it. The act of re-typing gives you a fresh perspective or helps you realize the task is disposable.
- **Avoid Knobs and Dials:** Reject tags, colors, and complex priority levels. They add seconds of friction that multiply across thousands of tasks.
- **End State:** The goal is an empty list every night. (Like [[Inbox Zero]])
