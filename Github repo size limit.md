There's no repo size limit on [[GitHub]]

But if your repo size hits 5gb you may get an email from github support querying what exactly you’re doing that is taking up so much space.

E.g. use for free personal photo backup is likely not allowed.
For that, there's a bigger allowance on [[Google Photos]].
