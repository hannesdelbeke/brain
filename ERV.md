An ERV is like a whole-home fan with two extra steps. Not only does it control heat like an HRV system does, but it also controls humidity. The difference between an HRV and ERV is simply that: **an ERV also takes the humidity out of the outgoing air and puts it into the incoming air**.

from wiki:
An ERV is a type of air-to-air heat exchanger that transfers [sensible heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_heat "Sensible heat") as well as [latent heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat "Latent heat"). Because both temperature and moisture are transferred, ERVs are described as total [enthalpic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpic "Enthalpic") devices 
In contrast, a heat recovery ventilator ([[Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery|MVHR]] / HRV) can only transfer sensible heat

all ERVs are HRVs, but not all HRVs are ERVs
