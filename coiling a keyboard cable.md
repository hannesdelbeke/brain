Anyone spending time around me eventually finds out I like crafting & dislike waste.

Recently I was annoyed at my messy cables on my desk. I already repurposed a Velcro wrap to contain the cables of my keyboard, but it wasn't pleasing to the eye.
Why am I drawn to buy new things, if I have something that's functional?

I decided to follow a YouTube tutorial to coil my cable, by putting it in the oven. The result looked & felt professional. I was so pleased I coiled a second cable in my house.

This often raises the question between efficiency and fun.
Coiling this cable was fun, and made me feel as if I "saved the planet" from waste.
Yet buying a new cable is cheaper in sense of time spent. And if I truly wanted to save the planet there are better ways to reduce my footprint.
But I'd be less fulfilled.

I like things with a story. Only a few things, so I remember where they came from, or when I made or found them.

It's 1 year later, and now I take the coiled cable for granted and barely remember I did this myself. 
But I'm still happy with the reduced cable mess.
