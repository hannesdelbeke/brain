I want to [[write more]] [[note taking|notes]] while on location: on holiday, commuting, waiting.
I rather write notes & stories than watch [[reels]], but reels are more accessible.

- how can I write when not at my pc?
	- get [[portable]] [[hardware]]
	- make it a [[habit]] of always bringing the hardware
- make it a habit to write instead of watch reels

## Get portable hardware
> [!NOTE]- My laptop is too big to always have one me
> My [[laptop]] is too big and heavy for easily carrying in my backpack when I go on a trip. I want to take it on a train, and a plane. 

> [!NOTE]- I consider a tablet
> So I need something [[portable]] & thin. Like a [[tablet]] with keyboard. Or a mini laptop.
> 
> I have [[my calendar tablet modelXXX|an android tablet i use for viewing my calendar]]
> - but it feels slow, I think it might crash when writing notes.
> - I have no keyboard for it yet
> - I need to setup note sync on Android again. e.g. [[Obsidian plugin - Git]]  but I remember 
> 	 - sync issues losing notes and needing manual merging
> 	 - and [[obsidian git backup can fail]] when there's a conflict
> - Moving to a cloud solution like google or [[Notion]] doesn't seem right atm
> - I could not sync, and write independent notes. E.g. [[journaling]] how I feel today.

> [!NOTE]- Can I use my macbook ? 
> What if at home I try using the [[Macbook]] for writing? I would need to find a way to ensure work is not spying on me. Since it's a work laptop and the notes are private.
> 
> And the macbook is still pretty big

- [ ] Get a tablet or mini laptop.
- [ ] When I forget the tablet, I want to take notes on my phone.

### Habits
make it a habit to 
- [ ] bring the tablet
- [ ] sync notes before I go / shut down pc.
- [ ] write when bored, instead of watch reels

See [[thomas j frank notes - The Power of Habit]]
To break an old habit (reels), i need to give a reward to my new habit
The cue is: I'm bored. The reward: stimulation without thinking.
Since writing is an active thing, it might be hard to replace reels with writing.
