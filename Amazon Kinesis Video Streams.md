# Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
Amazon Kinesis Video Streams makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS
for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing. Kinesis Video Streams automatically
provisions and elastically scales all the infrastructure needed to ingest streaming video data from
millions of devices. It also durably stores, encrypts, and indexes video data in your streams, and allows
you to access your data through easy-to-use APIs. Kinesis Video Streams enables you to playback
video for live and on-demand viewing, and quickly build applications that take advantage of computer
vision and video analytics through integration with Amazon Rekognition Video, and libraries for ML
frameworks such as Apache MxNet, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
