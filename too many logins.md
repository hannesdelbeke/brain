too many log ins and 2FA slow down the whole log in process.
often when I log in
- log in [[password manager]]
- possible 2FA for password manager
- log in original service
- 2FA for sercice, e.g. email pin or code

how to speed up
- [[password manager]] that auto completes
- to not manually click log in, we can use browser scripts, [[Tampermonkey]], that auto log in with autocompleted info.
	- [ ] can i make a preset for this that is 1 click setup for new site? current setup is slow

are there ways for android?
- logging in [[bitwarden]] everytime w fingerprint is slow
- [[google authenticator]] is faster but less reliable
