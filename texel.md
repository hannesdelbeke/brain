Texel stands for **TEX**ture pix**EX** or texture element. 
It's an image region

Textures are represented by arrays of texels representing the texture space, 
just as other images are represented by arrays of pixels.

A [[GPU]] takes these texels and projects them onto the pixels on your screen through texture mapping _(This is why we have UV’s)_
