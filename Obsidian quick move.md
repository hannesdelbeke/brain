To quickly move [[Obsidian]] notes to public or private folders, you can make a custom command with the QuickAdd plugin.

## Instructions
- install & enable the plugins from settings / browse community plugins
	- commander 
	- QuickAdd
- create a scripts folder in your vault, e.g. `_scripts`
- add the move script
	- [[move to folder.js]]
- setup 2 macros
- add the script to both macros
- click the gear icon to enter settings
- set your target folders
- restart obsidian
- click âš¡to expose the macros as commands
- now you can create a button to move the file with commander

now we have an extra scripts folder that we can't hide by default.
use `file hider` plugin to hide this folder.
