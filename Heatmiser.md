A NeoStat (non wifi) needs the neohub to connect to the router & app.
- v3 requires neoHub Gen 2 or later
- v2 - Fully compatible with all neoHub generations


Home Assistant Heatmiser Neo integration uses local LAN control
it uses cloud for auth, and using the android app. but it's locally for control and data.
- you can use neohub and block cloud access.
- older thermostats are compatible with RS485 Modbus.
	- Requires replacing thermostats
	- Requires wiring changes
	- No mesh network — everything is wired
