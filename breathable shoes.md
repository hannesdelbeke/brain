bought shitty yellow trail runners, very breathy
	- cold when wind gets in them, toes freeze
	- dry quick
	- still a little somp-somp when wet and walking. cause no drainage

- expensive salomons.
	- think they shrunk after washing
	- sweaty feet even though gore tex.

- hike w cheap decathlon Kalenji trainers.
	- pretty breathy,
	- no grip
	- less support at the laces etc.

### research
- [fresh foam](https://www.newbalance.co.uk/fresh-foam/) is not related to water, but cushioning instead
- decathlon - new feel- PW 500 Fresh Men's Fitness Walking Shoes
	- venting through sole, looks good
	- sold out
- Columbia Drainmaker III Walking Shoes (a water shoe)
	- ![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSYwcOuHKtT5S8jjUcUQud8pnPB1iP86qFepp6leB2zAHGCTIOnqje_EGETV94d94qMuZM4lxsPx_dHYDyyk5nZs4AByHSkaw&usqp=CAY)
