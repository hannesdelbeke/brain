#### Bloatware plugins
- [[Pyblish]] registers some default plugins to get you started, great for starters but annoying after a while since you have to explicitly deregister them every time.
  (which is an [[explicit]] thing to do)

This wouldn't be an issue if plugins were registered explicitly. see [[Pyblish issue - has no explicit plugin control]]
