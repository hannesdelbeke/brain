Triglycerides are a combination of three fatty acids or fats ( saturated
fat, unsaturated fat or both) and glycerol, which is a form of [[glucose]].
Triglycerides are the main source of energy and are supplied in our
diet but there is also a supply made in the body by the [[liver]].

Foods containing triglycerides, such as meat, dairy produce, cooking
oils and fats, are absorbed by the intestines and then packaged into
particles called lipoproteins, (known as chylomicrons) which carry the
triglycerides to tissues as an immediate source of energy or for
storage to be used when they required.

Triglycerides made by the body in the liver are carried in a different
type of lipoprotein known as VLDL (very low density lipoprotein).
