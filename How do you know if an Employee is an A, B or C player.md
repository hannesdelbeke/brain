Everyone wants as many A Players as possible on the team. But what does an [[A Player]] actually look like?

To identify if an employee is an [[A player|A]], [[B player|B]] or [[C player]], I consider 4 criteria:

1. What happens when you delegate to them?
2. What happens when you recruit?
3. What happens when they need to do something new?
4. What happens when they are blocked?

Now, to look at A, B, C players based on that criteria:

## A Players

- _When you delegate to them,_ you are confident it will get done
- _When you recruit,_ you looks for others that are similar
- _When they need to do something new,_ they teach themselves
- _When they are blocked,_ they ask for help

## B Players

- _When you delegate to them,_ they get it mostly done, but need guidance
- _When you recruit,_ you always look for someone better
- _When they need to do something new,_ you have to guide them towards how to learn it
- _When they are blocked,_ they waste time trying to figure it out inefficiently, rather than admit they are struggling

## C Players

- _When you delegate to them,_ you are worried it won’t get done well
- _When you recruit,_ you purposefully look for someone very different
- _When they need to do something new,_ you need to precisely show them exactly how to do it, and it often still gets done wrong
- _When they are blocked,_ they rarely ask for help and instead just let the project slip

While there are certainly other criteria a CEO can use, I’ve found this a good start to understand who your A, B and C players are. As you think about how to effectively manage each of these types, consider:

## 1. Set clear objectives and definitions for success

Everyone needs to be aligned on what the objectives are, and how success is being measured. A players will be eager to be a part of the process to define it. For B players, it’s important that they feel bought into the process, even if they may not contribute as much. C players will find excuses why the objectives are unachievable and success unrealistic.

## 2. Hold everyone accountable for delivering results

A very quick way to expose A, B, C players is truly holding everyone accountable for delivering results. Part of why I built [Weekly Update](https://www.getweeklyupdate.com/) (a tool for teams to share status updates each week) is because I saw the value of getting objectives and progress in writing. It is the only way people can be truly held accountable. A players will be eager to participate, highlight their wins and comment on losses. B players will as well, but may be more reserved in how they share. C players will want to avoid this at all costs, because it exposes their failure to deliver.
