e.g. credit card, savings, mortgage, ...
your earnings and savings are gone, your debts are gone, ...

what if a lot of data was wiped, but not vital things like finance and ID.
only personal data. 
e.g. all your [[repository|repos]], all your digital [[note taking|notes]], the story you wrote, the art you made.
wiped like a [[chalk board]]

What if you lose your friends contact details?
Some close friends would be easy to reach out to, but what about friends in other countries?
Maybe you forgot their last name, how will you find them again?

this was inspired by talking about how the [[sun]] could cause an EMP
[[philosophy]]
