## problem solve techniques
It's always good to isolate the problem and solve it piece by piece. 
While maintaining some form of higher level overview that enables you to step back and see the whole picture. e.g. a design document or user story.

- identify & define the problem
	- understand the complexity
	- (easy) affinity diagrams, group related notes
	- (hard) cause & effect diagram 
	- (easy) flow charts to describe processes and choices
	- (medium) swim lane diagram
	- (hard) systems diagram
	- (easy) drill down technique
- brainstorm solutions
- evaluate alternatives, do you have to solve this problem
- decide which solution, or plan RnD
- implement
- evaluate (and repeat cycle if it didn't work)
