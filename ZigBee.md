ZigBee is like [[WiFi]] but uses less power, so it's better for many [[Internet of things|IoT]] devices.
It transfers less data, so needs less power
- so not great for fast or heavy connections like streaming video. 
- But good for turning a light on and off.

It requires a Zigbee hub. 
- This can either then connect to a server on the internet [[Smart Life]], 
- or a [[self hosted server]] like [[Home Assistant]] or [[zigbee2mqtt]].
