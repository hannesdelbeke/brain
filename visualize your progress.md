### visualize your progress

Visualizing your progress helps you to **stay motivated**. You can look back on past results, and see your improvements. It creates a sense of accomplishment.

It allows you to **review your own work** better. Often when looking back on work a few days later, you can observe it more critically, and spot areas to improve.

It makes it easier to **ask for feedback**. You can share an image with someone. Or post it on a forum.

It's helpful if you can **show the outcome** of your learnings to interviewers. 
It makes it easier to [[build a portfolio]], and make **documentation**.

GIFs & videos are often better than a picture.
- ScreenToGif is a great GIF recorder for windows
- OBS is great for recording videos
