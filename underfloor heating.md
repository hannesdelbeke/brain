Radiant heating systems supply heat directly to the floor or to panels in the wall or ceiling of a house.

Radiant heating is the effect you feel from the warmth of a hot stovetop.

When radiant heating is located in the floor, it is often called radiant floor heating or simply floor heating. 
[[underfloor heating]] depends heavily on convection

There are three types of radiant floor heat 
- radiant air floors (air is the heat-carrying medium)
- electric radiant floors
- hot water (hydronic)

- **wet installations** make use of the large thermal mass of a concrete slab floor or lightweight concrete over a wooden subfloor
	- in **dry installations** the installer "sandwiches" the radiant floor tubing between two layers of plywood or attaches the tubing under the finished floor or subfloor
