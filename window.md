a piece of glass in the wall of a [[house]]

- A typical window has an R-value ranging from 0.9 to 3.0. Double-pane: 2–3 on average.
- Typical recommendations for exterior walls are **R-13 to R-23**, while R-30, R-38 and R-49 are common for ceilings and attic spaces. [source](https://www.jm.com/en/homeowner-insulation/homeowner-faq/what-r-value-do-i-need-/#.)
- [table](https://cellularwindowshades.com/content/33-rvalue-and-insulating-cellular-window-treatments) compares R values for honeycomb shades with tracks. (source is a blinds seller)
- I remember reading a paper that said [[side tracks]] are more important than type of blinds.
