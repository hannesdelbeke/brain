Lately I've been typing mostly on my [[razor blade 15 rz09-02705w76 2018|razor blade 15]] keyboard.
I've not used [[KB Paradise KBPV6000|my keyboard]] for months.
- It's annoying to plug in again after traveling with my laptop.
- I need to move it when I'm cleaning.
- I unplug it due to limited USB ports, and don't end up plugging it back in

Do I need a keyboard atm? I'm not sure.
It would be less bulky than a laptop on my desk.
