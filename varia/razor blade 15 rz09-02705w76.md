> [!USB-A Charging Downstream Port]-
> The USB-A port on the left side of your Razer Blade is a [[Charging Downstream Port]] (CDP) that can provide up to 5 V and 1.5 A charging current.
> 
> **Note:** For Razer Blade models with two USB-A ports on the left side, the second or the farthest port from the power connector has this feature.
> 
> This port also allows charging while your laptop is turned off as long as the power adapter is connected.

Third party docks (**nvm no charge support for my blade**)
- Caldigit TB4 dock (98W) doesn't charge 2019 Blade 15
- It does charge 2021 Blade 15 on light load
- Anker 577 works for light load, better in USB C than thunderbolt, lower latency. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/111ocvs/comment/j8sxfc9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- tested with dell 230W dock, no charge. works with mouse, display, keyboard, ethernet.

- [[Discrete GPU|dGPU]] stays active for the thunderbolt dock displays, resulting in higher power usage.

non charging docks
- You can get bus-powered Thunderbolt 3 adapters which turn Thunderbolt into DP, Ethernet and USB. They are technically not docks but they can serve that purpose. They get their power from the laptop.
