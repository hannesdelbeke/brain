A Conveyancer is someone who can help you through the process of selling buying or mortgaging a property.
When your bank or estate agent tells you that you need a Conveyancer, they mean someone who specializes in the legal aspect of transferring property from one person to another.

A conveyancer can also be a [[solicitor]], licensed conveyancer or a Chartered Legal Executive.
