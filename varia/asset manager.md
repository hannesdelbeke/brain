An asset manager is a tool to visually browse assets.
Useful when a studio has thousands of assets, and the assets do not have a thumbnail, or are hard to search in explorer.

- a folder with subfolders containing various files each. hiding the name and preview image

An asset browser speeds up finding the right asset instantly, by providing a search and visual preview.

Blender has a [file browser](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/file_browser.html), which is basic and similar to the experience in explorer.
