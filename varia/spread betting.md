### capital gains tax
Spread betting profits are free from capital gains tax, 
CFDs are liable because they are a financial instrument. 

This may seem a major drawback, but any losses can be offset against future profits for tax purposes, which makes CFDs good for **hedging** (see below).

**stamp duty** on share trades doesn't apply to either spread betting or CFDs, as you never own the underlying shares in either case.
