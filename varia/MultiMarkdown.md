MultiMarkdown, or MMD, is a tool to help turn minimally marked-up plain text into well formatted documents, including HTML.

In order to create valid [HTML], you need properly coded syntax that can be cumbersome for "non-programmers" to write. Sometimes, you just want to easily make certain words **bold**, and certain words *italicized* without having to remember the syntax. 
Additionally, for example, creating lists:

* should be easy
* should not involve programming
