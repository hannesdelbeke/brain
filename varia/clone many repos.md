when wanting to do small changes, on many repos, my current clone process is slow and inconvenient.
- current process:
	- copy link manually in GitHub
	- clone in Fork
	- mess with code
	- create fork in GitHub
	- change remote
	- push to fork
	- PR
- if I fork from start I save some steps
	
I need something to easy fork, clone, edit, PR.
a workflow where it's fast to pull a repo, so I don't hesitate to get hands on.
can I do this from within PyCharm? 
	but usually I'm in another project in PyCharm
