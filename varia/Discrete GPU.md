A **discrete GPU** occupies its own chip, and so does not share the same die as a CPU. This allows the GPU to have its dedicated memory, and additional space for the chip maker to fit more transistors and cores to increase the performance ceiling.

When speaking of desktop PCs, a dGPU will be found inside the graphics card, which will have its own built-in memory and cooling system. For laptops, the dGPU takes the form of a chip, separate to that of the CPU. A laptop with a dGPU will generally have a superior graphics performance to a laptop with an iGPU

Discrete GPUs typically offer a better performance
