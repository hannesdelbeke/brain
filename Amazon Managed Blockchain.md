# Amazon Managed Blockchain
Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and manage
scalable blockchain networks using the popular open source frameworks Hyperledger Fabric and
Ethereum.
Blockchain makes it possible to build applications where multiple parties can execute transactions
without the need for a trusted, central authority. Today, building a scalable blockchain network with
existing technologies is complex to set up and hard to manage. To create a blockchain network, each
network member needs to manually provision hardware, install software, create and manage certificates
for access control, and configure networking components. Once the blockchain network is running, you
need to continuously monitor the infrastructure and adapt to changes, such as an increase in transaction
requests, or new members joining or leaving the network.
Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that allows you to set up and manage a scalable
blockchain network with just a few clicks. Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required
to create the network, and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications
running millions of transactions. Once your network is up and running, Managed Blockchain makes
it easy to manage and maintain your blockchain network. It manages your certificates, lets you easily
invite new members to join the network, and tracks operational metrics such as usage of compute,
memory, and storage resources. In addition, Managed Blockchain can replicate an immutable copy of
your blockchain network activity into Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), a fully managed
ledger database. This allows you to easily analyze the network activity outside the network and gain
insights into trends.
