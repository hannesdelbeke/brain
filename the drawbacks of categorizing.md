It can be hard to [[categorize]].

Often people expect things to neatly fit in a category. Like this:

| fruit | vegetable |
| ----- | --------- |
| apple | cabbage   |
But what if we have something that fits in both categories? Like a tomato? 
We could put it in both categories: 

| fruit | vegetable |
| ----- | --------- |
| apple | cabbage   |
But this might 
- cause issues with people's expectations
- cause problems with software expecting something to be in 1 category
- duplicating data in 2 places can lead to a lack of [[single source of truth]]

When writing [[note taking|notes]] we run in the same problem. Often we start with multiple folders, 1 for each category. And we organize our files in the folders. 
But when we have thousands of files, there will be notes that belong in multiple categories. 
I start to waste a lot of time thinking which folder to put it in. This is a [[cognitive load]] with zero productive value, and can be avoided by [[reducing note folders|putting all notes in a single folder]]. Instead of trying to organize and choosing a single category (folder) for the file, we can create an infinite amount of links inside a note to other notes. This means a note can be linked to multiple categories. 1 note for each category.
