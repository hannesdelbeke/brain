### Pros
- A ceiling fan is **quieter** than a portable fan. The bigger blades move the same amount of air with a slower rotation.
- A cleaner look, integrated in the room, compared to desk fans. 
  Because it's [[raised of the floor]], cleaning your desk or floor doesn't become harder.
- Save money on air conditioning in the summer
	- [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778819300039) claims 15% [[alternating current|AC]] reduction
	- [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132323007011) claims Elevated air movement reduced cooling energy requirements by 32%.
	- [research](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/19/6807) claims higher fan speeds don't increase AC savings
### Cons
- Always visible even when not in use. Increasing visual noise and clutter, takes up desk space, and gathers dust.
- More costly to install than a [[table fan]].



### blade count
Adding more blades (and keeping the same [[solidity ratio]]) reduces this noise while maintaining the same air flow.

if you replace a light and no electrical box exist, you can use a saf-t brace, or a fan rated pancake box.
