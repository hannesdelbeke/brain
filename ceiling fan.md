- A ceiling fan is quieter than a portable fan. The bigger size means it can rotate slower to move the same amount of air.
- A cleaner look, integrated in the room
- Save money on air conditioning in the summer
### Cons
- Always visible even when not in use. Increasing visual noise.
- More costly to install than a [[table fan]].
